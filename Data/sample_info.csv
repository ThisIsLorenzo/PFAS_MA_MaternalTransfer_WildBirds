Frozen samples were stored in the ECNWSB at 40 C prior to chemical analysis. Shortly after arrival at the EC-NWSB, the eggs were processed by separating and homogenizing the yolk and albumen and storing them at -40 C until chemical analysis. Animal capturing, handling and euthanasia were approved by the Animal Care Committee for NWRC and Ontario region of the Canadian Wildlife Service (Environment Canada)."""
