rayyan-830248750,Distribution and partitioning of organic pollutants and effects in coastal birds,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vicente de Bobes, Joana",http://hdl.handle.net/2117/95260,eng,Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,NA,"Coastal areas are very susceptible to contamination due to the interaction of marine and anthropogenic processes. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds very resistent to photolysis and chemical and biological degradation. According to its physicochemical characteristics, POPs are worldwide distributed. These contaminants tend to bioaccumulate through the food webs, so that predators are more sensitive to this contamination. Seabirds are highly exposed to organic pollutants due to their feeding habits and its relatively long life. In this thesis, it has been studied the accumulation of various families of organic pollutants in two species of gulls breeding in the Iberian Peninsula, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) and Audouin's gull (L. audouinii). Yellow-legged gull is a large gull very common in the Iberian Peninsula. It is an omnivorous and opportunistic species. Audouin's gull is endemic of the Mediterranean region. Few years ago it was endangered but the great population growth made to be considered now as ""nearly threatened"" species. It is a piscivorous species but it is increasingly exploiting more fishery discards and continental preys. In the first study there are determined 6 families of organic pollutants considered by the Stockholm Convention (PCDD/Fs, PBDEs, PCBs, OCs, PFASs and SCCP) in eggs of the two gull species from the Ebro Delta Natural Park. In the following studies, the analyses are based on the study of PFASs in eggs and blood of both gull species and from different colonies of the Iberian Peninsula (Ebro Delta, Medes Islands, Columbretes Islands, Dragonera Island, Grosa Island, Chafarinas Islands, Atlantic Islands of Galicia and Berlengas Islands). From PFASs levels found in the different matrices the effect of these pollutants on physical (biometric parameters of egg, shell thickness and desiccation index) and hormonal level (through the analysis of the steroid hormones: testosterone and 17ß-estradiol) is studied. It is also assessed the accumulation of these pollutants from the diet of both species (analyzing their own food and through the study of the stable isotopes d13C and d15N, as dietary tracers) and it is estimated the PFASs depuration in blood and its transfer from females to eggs. The results indicate that organic pollutants are present in the populations of yellow-legged and Audouin's gull breeding in the Iberian Peninsula colonies, being OCs and PCBs the families of compounds with higher concentrations. Among PFASs, the main compound detected in all samples was PFOS. The transfer of organic contaminants from mother to offspring is demonstrated with the levels found in eggs of both species. Analysis of PFASs in blood of males and females shows that females discharge a fraction of the compounds accumulated to the eggs, thus females had lower blood PFASs levels than males. However, the study of hormonal level allows the comparison between the levels in both gull species and with other studies and to discuss the influence of the different diet. The analysis of PFASs in albumen and egg suggests that these compounds have more affinity for egg-yolk lipids because they are not detected in albumen. The decreasing concentration of PFOS along the egg sequence shows that females PFOS transfer is higher in the first egg but there is also a good correlation between the levels of PFOS among the 3 eggs from the same clutch. The higher concentrations of some PFASs in 3rd eggs (c), comparing with 1st (a) and 2nd (b), and the differences in d13C values between the a-b and b-c eggs are attributed to the ""mother effect"". This thesis permits increase the knowledge about the accumulation of POPs in yellow-legged and Audouin's gull from the Iberian Peninsula, to evaluate the differences between the two species and determine the geographical distribution of POPs using eggs as a biomarker of environmental contamination and to study the processes of accumulation and transfer of PFAS ; Les zones costaneres són unes àrees molt sensibles a la contaminació degut a la interacció entre els processos marins i antropogènics. Els emissaris submarins, les desembocadures dels rius, les activitats portuàries, l’abocament de residus, l’aqüicultura, etc. Són algunes de les activitats que poden produir la contaminació de les zones costaneres. Entre d’altres tipus de contaminants, es troben els contaminants orgànics persistents (COPs), aquells compostos orgànics que, en diferent grau, presenten resistència a la fotòlisis, la degradació química i la biològica. Degut a les seves característiques fisico-químiques, els COPs estan distribuïts per tot el món, podent trobar-se fins i tot en zones prístines molt allunyades de la seva font d’emissió original. Aquests contaminants tendeixen a bioacumular-se al llarg de les cadenes tròfiques, de manera que els grans depredadors són més sensibles a aquesta contaminació. Les aus marines estan molt exposades als contaminants orgànics degut als seus hàbits alimentaris i a la seva esperança de vida relativament llarga. En aquesta tesi s’ha estudiat l’acumulació de vàries famílies de contaminants orgànics en dues espècies de gavina de la Península Ibèrica, el gavià argentat (Larus michahellis) i la gavina corsa (L. audouinii). El gavià argentat és una gavina de grans dimensions molt comuna a la Península Ibèrica. És una espècie omnívora i oportunista. S’alimenta tant de recursos marins, com terrestres, com depredant sobre altres aus i també freqüenta abocadors i descarts pesquers. La gavina corsa és una gavina de dimensions mitjanes, endèmica de la regió mediterrània. Fa uns anys estava en situació de risc però el fort creixement poblacional de les últimes dècades l’ha deixat fora de perill sent considerada actualment a nivell internacional com a “quasi amenaçada”. És una espècie piscívora però cada vegada explota més descarts pesquers. En el primer estudi s’analitzen 6 famílies de contaminants orgànics inclosos o sota consideració pel Conveni d’Estocolm (els PCDD/Fs, PBDEs, PCBs, OCs, PFASs i SCCPs) en els ous de les dues espècies de gavina de les respectives colònies del Parc Natural del Delta de l’Ebre. A partir d’aquí els següents treballs es basen en l’estudi de la família dels PFASs en sang i ous d’ambdues espècies i pertanyents a diferents colònies de la Península Ibèrica (Delta de l’Ebre, Illes Medes, Illes Columbretes, Illa de Sa Dragonera, Illa Grosa, Illes Chafarinas, Illes Atlàntiques de Galicia i Ilhas Berlengas), totes en zones d’alt interès ecològic i sota alguna protecció ambiental (parcs naturals, nacionals, reserves marines, reserva de la biosfera, etc.). A partir dels nivells de PFASs trobats en les diferents matrius (primers ous de la posta, clara i rovell d’ou dels 3 ous de la posta i sang d’exemplars adults) s’estudia l’efecte d’aquests contaminants a nivell físic (paràmetres biomètrics de l’ou, gruix de la closca i índex de dessecació) i hormonal (via l’anàlisi de les hormones esteroidees 17β-estadiol i testosterona). S’estudia també l’acumulació d’aquests contaminants a partir de la dieta (analitzant el seu propi aliment i a partir de l’estudi dels isòtops estables de carboni i nitrogen (δ13C i δ15N), indicadors del règim alimentari) i es fa una estima de la depuració dels PFASs en sang i de la seva transferència de femelles a ous. Els resultats indiquen que els contaminants orgànics són presents en les poblacions de gavià argentat i gavina corsa de la Península Ibèrica, sent els OCs i els PCBs les famílies de compostos amb concentracions més elevades. Entre els PFASs, el compost majoritari és el PFOS. La transferència de contaminants orgànics de mares a cries queda demostrada amb els nivells trobats en els ous d’ambdues espècies. De l’anàlisi de PFASs en sang de mascles i femelles de les dues espècies de gavina s’observa que les femelles descarreguen part dels compostos acumulats als ous presentant així nivells en sang inferior que els mascles. No es troba cap relació entre els nivells de PFASs i els paràmetres biomètrics, com tampoc amb els nivells d’esteroides. Tanmateix, l’estudi de les hormones permet comparar els nivells en ambdues espècies amb altres estudis i discutir la influència de la dieta. L’anàlisi de PFASs en clara i rovell d’ou per separat dels 3 ous de les postes de gavina corsa demostren que aquests compostos tenen més afinitat pels lípids del rovell ja que no es detecten en les clares. La concentració decreixent de PFOS al llarg de la seqüència de posta demostra que les femelles descarreguen la majoria de contaminant en el primer ou però que existeix una bona correlació dels nivells de PFOS entre els 3 ous d’un mateix niu. L’augment de les concentracions d’alguns PFASs en el 3r ou i les diferències en els valors de δ13C entre el 1r-3r i 2n-3r ou s’atribueixen a l’anomenat “efecte mare” (possible ús de reserves endògenes per a la formació de l’últim ou enlloc de l’energia aportada per la dieta prèvia a la posta). Aquesta tesi permet augmentar el coneixement sobre l’acumulació de COPs en el gavià argentat i la gavina corsa de la Península Ibèrica, avaluar les diferències entre ambdues espècies i associar-ho a la seva biologia, determinar la distribució geogràfica de COPs utilitzant els ous com a bioindicador de contaminació ambiental i estudiar els processos d’acumulació i transferència de PFASs. ; Postprint (published version)",NA,NA,NA

It is a source of food and livelihood for millions of people—most of them from developing countries. The western Indian Ocean (WIO) extends from the shores of Somalia to South Africa, and as far eastward as the Mauritian Outer Islands. Fewer ecotoxicological studies have been conducted in the WIO compared with other regions, and even less in the Mascarene Basin. This study aims to enhance the ecotoxicological knowledge of three tropical islands in the Mascarene Basin. Four aspects of ecotoxicology are covered in four article manuscripts published or submitted to international journals. The first ecotoxicological aspect is the transport of pollutants to remote islands through shipwrecks. Shipwrecks cause ecological harm by physically damaging reef systems when grounding and subsequently causing long-term toxicological harm when pollutants leach from the wreck to the surrounding reef system. This has the potential to kill corals, destabilising the base of the coral reef ecosystem. Secondly, halogenated pollutants were quantified in coral reef biota. This is also the first report of brominated compounds in coral. Brominated and chlorinated compounds were quantified in hard- and soft coral and fish from St. Brandon’s Atoll (SBR), Agalega, and Rodrigues for the first time. Soft coral contained higher concentrations than hard coral for all persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Hard coral contained higher concentrations of novel brominated flame retardants than soft coral. Fish consistently had higher concentrations than hard coral but did not differ significantly. The widespread occurrence of pentabromotoluene (PBT) was confirmed in reef biota for the first time, raising the question if PBT should be considered as a candidate POP. The third article investigated the concentrations of POPs in seabird eggs of fairy terns, sooty terns, and common noddies from SBR. Sooty- and fairy terns forage further offshore and were seemingly exposed to more pollutants. This study also reported POPs in the eggs of a terrestrial species—chicken—from the Mascarene Basin for the first time. This suggests aerial transport of pollutants to the WIO. Concentrations of pollutants in the eggs were lower than other values found in literature. I quantified perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the eggs of seabirds and chickens from SBR in the final article – the first for the WIO. Fairy tern eggs contained the highest concentrations of PFAS, followed by sooty terns, then common noddies. Long-chained PFAS were prevalent over short chained PFAS. All chicken eggs contained quantifiable concentrations of PFAS, again suggesting aerial transport. The concentrations of pollutants in all biota that were quantified were lower than reported from elsewhere. The remote nature and lack of industry in the Mascarene Basin contributed to low concentrations of pollutants in biota. The Mascarene Basin would be an ideal location to monitor background concentrations of pollutants. The fact that pollutants could be quantified in remote tropical islands in the WIO shows how ubiquitous pollutants are distributed in the environment and may contribute towards identifying candidate POPs. ; Doctoral",NA,NA,NA

Their properties make them extremely resistant and they have been shown to have bioaccumulation and toxic properties in the environment and also to biomagnify in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. This study has analysed different PFASs in African Darter (Anhinga rufa) eggs from five sites along Vaal River; Orange River, South Africa. Sixteen of 23 analysed PFASs were detected and quantified, and the homologue profiles were studied from all five sites. Total perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (all structural isomers) was the predominated compound of all PFASs, accounting for 88-98% for all sites, with a median concentration range of 58 ng/g ww to 2473 ng/g ww. The second highest concentration was found for perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) (1.9-42 ng/g ww), followed by perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (1.1-14 ng/g ww) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) (0.68-6.0 ng/g ww). The results showed significantly that the three up-stream sites (Welverdiend, Schoemansdrift and Orkney East) had similar patterns and that eggs from Schoemansdrift had the highest levels of PFASs. This may indicate the same source of origin for these three sites and that Schoemansdrift are closest to the contamination source. The three sites (Welverdiend, Schoemansdrift and Orkney East) with similar pattern is closest to Gauteng, which can be where the emission source is located, because it is an industrial area. Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and PFOS might originate from different sources and the source for PFCAs could be degradation of fluorotelomer-based precursors. Structural isomer profiles of PFOS showed similar results as the PFAS homologue patterns, which give further indication of the source of origin. The contribution of linear PFOS (L-PFOS) to the total amount of PFOS was between the range of 94 and 97%. Bloemhof had the highest concentration of branched isomers among all sites. The L-PFOS concentrations in Bloemhof were also significantly differ from Schoemansdrift. This indicate two different sources between Bloemhof and the three up-steam sites, or an effect of environmental fractionation.",NA,NA,NA

Among them, environmental contamination is particularly concerning for living organisms. Used and released in industrialized countries, these highly persistent contaminants can reach remote areas such as the Arctic ecosystem and will biomagnify though food webs and bioaccumulate in organisms. Long-lived seabirds are located in the upper levels of the food chains and thus particularly exposed and sensitive to a chronic contaminants exposure. Through endocrine disruption, these contaminants can impact physiological mechanisms and behavioural traits, inducing in fine, long-term fitness consequences on individuals and populations. My thesis focuses on three groups of contaminants: (i) poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), still broadly used in a vast array of industrial processes and increasing in the Arctic; (ii) “legacy” organochlorine contaminants (OCs, pesticides and industrial compounds), banned from use but still well present in the Arctic and (iii) mercury (Hg), a non-essential metal coming of both natural and anthropic origins. Based on a correlative approach conducted in natura, I investigated the physiological and behavioural consequences of exposure to these contaminants during the whole breeding cycle (from pre-laying to chick-rearing period) in an Arctic seabird, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) from Svalbard, Norwegian Arctic. Specifically, I examined the relationships between several PFASs, OCs, Hg and fertility (sperm morphology and motility), sexual signaling (visual: integument coloration and olfactory: chemical signature), parental care behaviors (incubation temperature and egg-turning), ageing (telomere length) and energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate). In addition, some potential underlying mechanisms were also studied to better understand the way through which contaminants can be detrimental for kittiwakes. Furthermore, since physiological mechanisms and behavioral traits investigated here are tightly involved in self maintenance and reproduction, possible effects on fitness are then discussed. This PhD work underlines the major role of certain legacy chlorinated organic compounds (e.g. chlordanes) and significantly contributes at documenting the poorly known toxicological consequences of PFASs exposure in wildlife. Importantly, this PhD shows that PFASs and OCs could impact ageing, energy expenditure and some parental care behaviors in a contrasted manner. Specifically, oxychlordane, a metabolite of a banned organochlorine pesticide was associated with decreased telomere length, lowered metabolic rate and reduced ability to incubate the eggs. Conversely, elongated telomere, increased BMR and enhanced egg rotation were observed in birds bearing the highest concentrations of PFASs. Finally, at least for the considered endpoints, Hg appears as a coming minor threat for kittiwakes. This study highlights the importance of considering several groups of contaminants when investigating the consequences of environmental contaminants exposure in wildlife. ; A cause d’une anthropisation toujours plus forte des écosystèmes, de plus en plus de menaces pèsent sur la biodiversité. Parmi celles-ci, l’exposition aux contaminants est particulièrement problématique pour les organismes vivants. Emis et utilisés dans les pays industrialisés, ces contaminants hautement persistants dans l’environnement vont gagner les régions polaires puis se bio-accumuler dans les organismes vivants au cours du temps et se bio-amplifier le long du réseau trophique. Ainsi, les oiseaux marins, longévifs et situés dans les maillons supérieurs de la chaine alimentaire, sont particulièrement exposés et vulnérables à une exposition chronique à ces contaminants. A travers une perturbation endocrinienne, ces contaminants vont pouvoir impacter certains mécanismes physiologiques et traits comportementaux, entrainant in fine des conséquences à long-terme sur la fitness des individus et populations. Ma thèse s’articule autour de trois grandes familles de contaminants : i) les composés perfluoroalkylés (PFASs), encore largement utilisés dans plusieurs secteurs industriels et agricoles et en augmentation dans l’environnement ; (ii) les composés organochlorés dits « d’héritage » (OCs), interdits depuis des années mais entrainants toujours des effets délétères sur la biodiversité et (iii) le mercure (Hg), métal lourd non-essentiel ayant une origine à la fois anthropique et naturelle. Basé sur une approche corrélative in natura, je me suis intéressé aux conséquences physiologiques et comportementales d’une exposition chronique à ces trois grandes familles de contaminants présents chez la mouette tridactyle (Rissa tridactyla) de l’Arctique Norvégien (Svalbard) au cours de son cycle reproducteur (depuis l’accouplement jusqu’à l’élevage des poussins). Spécifiquement, j’ai étudié les relations entre ces contaminants et la fertilité (morphologie et motilité des spermatozoïdes), l’expression des signaux sexuels (visuel : coloration des téguments, olfactif : signature chimique), les comportements de soins parentaux (température d’incubation et rotation de l’œuf), le vieillissement cellulaire (longueur des télomères) et la dépense énergétique (métabolisme de base). Je me suis également penché sur de potentiels mécanismes sous-jacents permettant d’expliquer ces relations. Puisque ces mécanismes physiologiques et comportementaux sont fortement impliqués dans la valeur sélective des individus, les possibles conséquences à long terme de cette exposition sur la reproduction et survie des individus sont discutées. Ce travail permet de souligner la forte toxicité de certains composés organochlorés « historiques » (en particulier les chlordanes) et d’apporter de toutes nouvelles connaissances sur la toxicité très mal connue des PFASs chez la faune sauvage. Fait important, ce travail de thèse révèle que les PFASs et les OCs pourraient agir de manière contrastée sur plusieurs mécanismes physiologiques et traits comportementaux. Spécifiquement, une forte exposition à l’oxychlordane, un métabolite du chlordane, pesticide interdit depuis des décennies, est associée à des télomères plus courts, une réduction du métabolisme de base et à une moindre capacité à incuber les œufs. A l’inverse, on observe une élongation des télomères, une augmentation du métabolisme de base et une rotation des œufs accrue chez les individus les plus exposés aux PFASs. Le Hg, au moins en ce qui concerne les paramètres étudiés, ne semble pas jouer un rôle majeur. Cette étude souligne l'importance de tenir compte de plusieurs groupes de contaminants lorsqu'on étudie les conséquences de l'exposition aux contaminants environnementaux chez la faune sauvage.",NA,NA,NA

The use of fluorotelomer compounds, short-chained homologues, and other PFASs with perfluorinated moieties has emerged recent years. One of these emerging compound classes is polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs), which have the ability to degrade into persistent PFCAs. The aim of this thesis was to assess the contribution of PAPs and other precursors to the exposure of PFCAs to humans and the environment. The main objective was to analyze a wide range of PFAS in human serum, wild bird eggs, indoor dust, waste water, and sludge. There was a significant contribution from selected precursors to the total amount of PFASs in the abiotic compartments indoor dust, waste water, and sludge. Levels of PAPs found in house dust exceeded those of PFCAs and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), revealing PAPs as a world-wide important exposure source. A net increase was during waste water treatment was observed for several PFASs in Swedish waste water treatment plants. Together with presence of precursor compounds and intermediates in the influent water and the sludge, this suggest that degradation of PFCA precursors contributed to the increase of PFCAs. Detection of precursors in human serum, together with slow declining trends of PFCAs, revealed an ongoing exposure of PFCAs to the general population of Australia. The diPAPs and the FTSAs were also detected in raptor bird eggs from Sweden from both the terrestrial and the freshwater environment. The precursors concentrations and patterns observed reveal that current regulatory measures are insufficient for the purpose of protecting humans and the environment from PFASs exposure.",NA,NA,NA

rayyan-830248760,Characterizing the chronic oral reproductive toxicity of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their mixtures to terrestrial ecological receptors to inform ecotoxicological risk assessment of PFAS-impacted ecosystems,2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dennis, Nicole M.",https://hdl.handle.net/2346/87987,eng,NA,NA,"Per‐ and poly‐fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a broad class of environmentally persistent chemicals that include thousands of potentially toxic synthetic organic molecules. Terrestrial toxicology data are particularly lacking in order to derive the toxicological reference values (TRVs) necessary to complete a comprehensive ecotoxicological risk assessment (ERA) of PFAS-impacted environments. This is partly due to the existence of PFAS as mixtures in the environment, which complicates logistical dose-response modeling and the establishment of threshold values that are used to characterize the chronic oral toxicity of PFAS solutions to ecological receptors. Characterizing the chronic toxicity of PFAS is necessary because of the global presence of PFAS in nearly every environmental compartment previously tested over the past two decades, now coupled with the adverse health effects reported in the epidemiological and toxicological literature regarding chronic PFAS exposure. To derive TRVs and complete comprehensive ERAs of PFAS-impacted ecosystems for wildlife inhabiting the area, species- and tissue-specific chronic toxicity values (CTVs) are required. Therefore, we set out to provide these necessary CTVs using a representative upland gamebird species for our model organism. To complete this goal, we performed four traditional avian reproductive toxicology studies according to current guidelines. We examined reproduction, growth, and survival endpoints using a combination of hypothesis testing and logistical dose-response modeling for a single avian species (Colinus Virginianus) chronically orally exposed via drinking water during reproduction to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), a binary PFOS and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) mixture, and a binary PFOS and PFHxA mixture. We further quantified and reported the PFAS residues from liver tissue and eggs from the test animals chronically exposed to the PFAS treatment levels that produced the no-observable-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and/or lowest-observable-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) thresholds in the model organism during the chronic exposures. Both NOAEL and LOAEL thresholds were established for each exposure based on observed chronic toxicity in several variables relative to the controls (e.g., reduced female weight gain, decreased offspring weight and growth rate at 21-days post-hatch, decreased successful liberation from the shell once pipped, increased infertility, reduced juvenile survival, decreased hatching success, and earlier arrested embryonic development). Based on these observed adverse health effects to avian receptors, the tissue-and species-specific PFAS LOAEL CTVs were estimated for oral exposure concentration, average daily intake (ADI), adult and juvenile liver tissue, and whole-egg homogenates. For single chemical avian exposure to PFOS, the estimated oral exposure concentration, ADI, adult liver-tissue, juvenile liver tissue, and a whole-egg homogenate LOAEL CTVs were 18.7 ng/mL, 2.45 × 10−3 mg/kg body weight/d, 21.4 ng/g wet wt, 23.7 ng/g wet wt, and 92.4 ng/g wet wt, respectively. For binary chemical avian exposure to a 1.2:1 PFOS:PFHxS mixture, the estimated oral exposure concentration, ADI, adult liver-tissue, juvenile liver tissue, and a whole-egg homogenate LOAEL CTVs were 22.9 ng/mL, 3.10 × 10−3 mg/kg body weight/d, 46.9 ng ∑PFAS/g wet wt, 22.7 ng ∑PFAS/g wet wt, and 81.3 ng ∑PFAS/g wet wt, respectively. For single chemical and binary chemical avian exposure to either PFHxA or 2.1-2.8:1 PFOS:PFHxA mixture solutions, the estimated oral exposure concentration, ADI, and whole-egg homogenates LOAEL CTVs were 0.10 and 0.06 ng/mL, 1.49x10-5 and 8.19x10-6 mg x kg bw-1 x d-1, and 0.092 and 0.890 ng/g wet wt, respectively. PFHxA and PFOS were not detected in the adult or juvenile liver tissues as a result of chronic oral exposure to PFHxA or the PFOS:PFHxA mixture at the treatment levels that produced the LOAEL CTVs. The CTVs estimated herein for NBQ presently exposed via drinking water are comparatively much lower than the current avian TRV estimated for PFOS derived from birds that were exposed via feed. Thus, the current avian PFOS TRV may not be fully protective of wild avian populations at PFAS‐impacted sites, suggesting the need for updated avian PFAS TRVs. Relationships between test chemicals (PFOS or PFHxA) and test substances (PFOS:PFHxS or PFOS:PFHxA) showed that PFOS may have possible interacting effects in avian receptors when mixed with either PFHxS or PFHxA and likely has differing mechanisms of toxicity depending on chemical co‐occurrence and dose. Comparison between like studies showed that PFHxA exposure was much more toxic to reproducing quail than PFOS exposure when each were administered singly as well as when the two were mixed vs when PFOS was mixed with another sulfonate as evidenced by the lower CTVs produced by exposure to PFHxA and the PFOS:PFHxA mixture vs PFOS and a PFOS and PFHxS mixture. This defies our assumptions regarding the relative toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of certain PFAS (i.e., longer vs shorter chained PFAS and sulfonated vs carboxylated PFAS). The results among all health parameters presently studied demonstrate that reaction(s) occur among the individual PFAS present in a PFAS mixture to alter the potential toxicity of the individual PFAS present in that mixture to exposed birds, indicating that mixtures play an important role in avian PFAS toxicity. Therefore, chronic oral PFAS toxicity to avian receptors represented as the sum of the individual toxicities of the measured PFAS may not necessarily be the best method for assessing chronic PFAS mixture exposure risk to avian receptors at PFAS-impacted sites. The mixture exposure CTVs presently estimated mirrored the single chemical exposure CTVs demonstrating that the toxicity of PFAS mixtures tends to mirror the toxicity of the single chemical within the mixture exhibiting the lowest CTV. Thus, ERAs completed using sum PFAS may severely underestimate health risk to avian receptors inhabiting PFAS-impacted ecosystems and could likely benefit from reassessment. The single-species avian PFAS LOAEL CTVs provided herein are representative of possible population-level adverse health effects, can be modified with the use of uncertainty factors to derive class-wide avian TRVs for site-specific ERAs, and are immediately useful for assessing reproductive health risk to wild avian receptors at PFAS-impacted sites. ; Embargo status: Restricted until September 2022.

Due to their wide-spread use and inherent resistance to degradation, several PFCs have become persistent environmental contaminants. Despite the high concentrations of PFCs reported in wild birds and their eggs, very little is known about the toxicological effects they have on avian species. This thesis investigates the developmental toxicity of PFCs in an avian model species: the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). Egg injection experiments were performed to assess the in ovo toxicity of perfluorooctane sulfonate (technical grade, T-PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA). Real-time RT-PCR was then used to measure the transcription of candidate biomarker genes in the liver tissue of day 20 embryos. Candidate genes were selected based on their responsiveness to PFC exposure in previously conducted in vitro screening assays. In ovo exposure to PFOS resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in embryo pipping success (a measure of hatching success) with an LD50 of 93 μg/g (3.54 μg/g-672,910 μg/g, 95% confidence interval), however the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα)-regulated genes was not affected in liver tissue as hypothesized. PFOA, PFDS and PFUdA had no effect on the pipping success of chicken embryos. The expression of cytochrome P450 1A4 (CYP1A4) and liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) mRNA increased in embryo liver tissue following in ovo exposure to PFUdA but was only statistically significant at 10 μg/g, which is several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations reported in wild bird eggs. The isomer-specific accumulation of PFOS in chicken embryo livers was also investigated using an in-port derivatization gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Prior to incubation, chicken eggs were injected with T-PFOS, composed of 63% linear isomer (L-PFOS) and 37.3% branched isomers. The isomer profiles in day-20 embryo liver tissue showed up to 20% enrichment in the proportion of L-PFOS, compared to T-PFOS, with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of branched isomers. This enrichment was inversely proportional to dose. Finally, the transcriptional profiles of cultured chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEH) exposed to either T-PFOS or L-PFOS were compared using Agilent 4x44k Chicken (V2) Gene Expression microarrays. At equal concentrations (10 μM), T-PFOS altered the expression of significantly more genes (340 genes, >1.5 fold change, false discovery rate adjusted p<0.05) compared to L-PFOS (130 genes). Functional analysis showed that L-PFOS and T-PFOS affected genes involved in lipid metabolism, cellular growth and proliferation, and cell-cell signaling. Pathway and interactome analysis suggested that gene expression may be affected through RXR, oxidative stress response, TP53 signaling, MYC signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling and PPARγ and SREBP receptors. In all functional categories and pathways examined, T-PFOS had a more pronounced disruptive effect on transctional regulation than L-PFOS. In summary, egg injection experiments showed that T-PFOS (but not linear PFOA, PFDS or PFUdA) may affect the hatching success of the chicken at environmentally relevant concentrations. It was also demonstrated that the accumulation of PFOS in embryonic liver is isomer specific, and leads to an enrichment of L-PFOS. The increased transcriptional disruption caused by T-PFOS in cultured hepatocytes over L-PFOS suggests that the branched isomers may be largely responsible for the toxicological effects of PFOS. Combined, the results from this thesis demonstrate the importance of considering PFOS isomer burdens during risk assessment. In addition, gene expression analysis identified several candidate mechanisms for PFOS toxicity.",NA,NA,NA

PFAAs, specifically perfluorinated sulfonates and carboxylates, are chemically stable and virtually non-biodegradable in the environment. In recent years, PFAAs have been detected in tissues and blood of humans and wildlife. Furthermore, PFAAs have a tendency to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in biota. Perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate are known to be toxic when animals are exposed to environmentally-relevant levels, but scientists and regulators are challenged with determining and predicting their modes of action. There is some evidence to suggest that PFAAs can impact the thyroid hormone (TH) pathway and neurodevelopment. The studies presented in this thesis investigated the developmental effects and potential modes of action of newer PFAAs that are being introduced into the global market place. Egg injection experiments were performed in domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) embryos to assess the in ovo toxicity of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA) during development. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure the transcription of candidate genes in the liver and cerebral hemisphere of day 21-22 embryos. Candidate genes were selected based on their responsiveness to PFAA exposure in an in vitro screening assay conducted previously. In ovo exposure to PFHxS decreased embryo pipping success and overall growth at 38,000 ng/g; several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations reported in wild bird eggs. The expression of TH-responsive genes, including type II and III 5'-deiodinase, neurogranin, and octamer motif binding factor 1, were induced. In addition, PFHxS diminished free thyroxine (T4) levels in plasma. PFHxA had no affect on pipping success, gene expression or T4 levels in chicken embryos at the doses assessed. The transcriptional profiles in the cerebral hemisphere of chicken embryos exposed to 890 and 38,000 ng/g PFHxS were compared to a solvent control using microarray technology. The expression of 78 different genes were significantly altered (fold change > 1.5, p < 0.001) by PFHxS. Functional analysis showed that PFHxS affected genes involved in tissue development and morphology and cellular assembly and organization. Pathway and interactome analysis suggested that gene expression may be affected through integrin receptors and signaling pathways via TH–dependent and –independent modes of action. It is expected that the findings presented in this thesis will be of general relevance and importance to regulatory agencies and of interest to research scientists and risk assessors.",NA,NA,NA

Immunomodulation is among the most concerning toxic effects linked with PFAS exposure in traditional animal models, and additional studies are needed to determine if and how these apply to birds. Innate immune system signalling pathways provide crucial responses against infection that initiate the clearance of pathogens, and these could be impaired by pollutant exposure. This study aimed to investigate the levels and sources of variation of PFASs in plasma (n=38) and feathers (n=39) from northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) nestlings, and evaluate specific immune effects linked with one of the most prominent PFAS using an in vitro avian model. The in vitro experiment was performed using chicken embryo fibroblasts exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and infected with gallid herpesvirus-2 (GaHV-2) or the RNA virus analogue poly(I:C). We investigated the expression of microRNA-155, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and TNF-α), the transcription factor NF-κB, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 at four consecutive time points following viral stimulation. Goshawk nestlings were found to be exposed to a wide range of PFASs, although at relatively low levels, and comparable to those found in previous studies on birds of prey. PFAS profiles differed between the studied regions, with perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) dominating plasma profiles in Troms and Trøndelag (Norway), and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) being the dominant class in Spanish birds: linear PFOS was at highest levels in Norway (mean: 6.37 ≈ 5.96 > 2.13 ng/mL), while perfluononanoic acid (PFNA) was the most abundant in Spanish nestlings (mean: 2.77 > 1.05 ≈ 0.75 ng/mL). In addition to the likely underlying contribution of local PFSA and PFCA contamination sources, the diet contributed to explain PFAS levels across goshawk nestlings, as individual burdens increased with trophic level. Additionally, this study showed that PFOS exposure could mediate a downregulation of constitutive immune gene expression in bird cells from 36h post-exposure. Overall, these findings indicate that PFOS might deregulate innate signalling pathways and cytokine release in birds, but results should be interpreted with care because the experimental dose of PFOS (22 ppm) is generally not relevant for bird exposure, and the effect of PFOS on virus activated pathways could not be demonstrated here. Further research on the impact of pollutants on host-virus interactions is recommended, as they have been overlooked and might contribute to understand disease outcomes and outbreaks in birds of prey, together with other factors like host genetics or the evolving nature of infectious agents.",NA,NA,NA

Several studies have reported in vitro and in vivo effects related to neuronal development, neural cell differentiation, pre- and post- natal development and behaviour. PFC exposure altered hormone levels (e.g. thyroid hormone, estrogen, and testosterone) and the expression of hormone-responsive genes in mammalian and aquatic species. Hormone-mediated events are critical in central nervous system development and function, especially those controlled by thyroid hormones (THs). The studies presented in this thesis are the first to assess the effects of PFCs on primary cultures of neuronal cells in two avian species; the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) and herring gull (Larus argentatus). The following TH-responsive genes were examined using real-time RT-PCR: type II iodothyronine 5’-deiodinase (D2), D3, transthyretin (TTR), neurogranin (RC3), octamer motif binding factor (Oct-1), and myelin basic protein (MBP). Several PFCs were shown to alter mRNA expression levels of genes associated with the TH pathway in avian neuronal cells. It was determined that short-chained PFCs (<8 carbons) altered the expression of TH-responsive genes to a greater extent than long-chained PFCs (≥8 carbons). Although several significant changes in mRNA expression were observed in TH-responsive genes following PFC exposure in chicken embryonic neuronal (CEN) cells (Chapter 2), there were fewer changes in herring gull embryonic neuronal (HGEN) cells (Chapter 3). The mRNA levels of D2, D3, TTR, and RC3 were altered following treatment with several short-chained PFCs in CEN cells. Oct-1 and RC3 expression were induced following treatment with several short-chained PFCs in HGEN cells. These studies are the first to report that PFC exposure alters mRNA expression in primary cultures of avian neuronal cells and provide insight into the possible mechanisms of action of PFCs in the avian brain.",NA,NA,NA

PFAAs are a class of persistent, anthropogenic pollutants used in a wide variety of products for their non-reactivity, including in aqueous firefighting foam (AFFF). This study evaluated if chronic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations could alter the health and reproductive fitness of adult birds and any negative impacts in ovo exposure may have on their offspring through maternal deposition into eggs. Secondary endpoints included examining how much accumulation of the target chemical occurs in liver tissue and how the body burden of PFOA and PFHpA, the two target PFAAs of this study, are altered by egg deposition. Furthermore, this project attempted to assess how much of the target chemical was present in egg yolk and how much juvenile quail retain after one month of growth. Chronic toxicity of the two target compounds was tested using Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) as the model species. Adult birds were exposed to drinking water containing nominal concentrations of 20 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, and 0.1 ng/mL of the target chemical over the course of study (90 days). Juvenile bobwhite offspring were assessed for 30 days to determine any potential fitness effects from in ovo exposure. Residue analysis was conducted on adult and juvenile liver tissue as well as on eggs. Neither PFHpA or PFOA reduced hatching success, reproduction, or adult or juvenile Northern bobwhite survival at 1.860 or 1.745 µg/kg/day, respectively. However, it did appear that chromic ingestion of PFOA (1.745 µg PFOA/kg/day) may significantly increase weight of hatchling birds after one week, an effect observed in other vertebrates. Furthermore, residue analysis confirmed that female birds do reduce their body burden of both PFOA and PFHpA through deposition to eggs. In addition, some non-significant patterns of liver damage were identified in adult birds following chronic exposure.",NA,NA,NA

However, the Russian settlements (Barentsburg and Pyramiden) in Svalbard have shown to be heavily influenced by local pollution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), as high concentrations have been found in vegetation, soil and sediments. The Norwegian settlements (Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund) are to a lesser extent influenced by local pollution of PCB. Birds have been utilized as sentinels for environmental pollution in several studies, as the use of bird-eggs is considered as a non-invasive method. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) is influenced by local pollution of PCB in the Russian settlements. During the 2010 field season and the 2011 field season, 32 eggs of snow buntings were collected in Longyearbyen (n=8), Ny-Ålesund (n=8), Barentsburg (n=9) and Pyramiden (n=7). The analysis was conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Air Research (NILU) in Tromsø. The eggs were analyzed for PCBs, organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluoroalkylated compounds (PFASs). The results showed that PCBs were the most abundant contaminant group in the Russian settlements, while PFASs was the most abundant contaminant group in the Norwegian settlements. Significant higher concentrations (ng/g wet weigth) of ∑7PCB (sum of the seven most common PCBs) were found in the eggs from the Russian settlements (Barentsburg and Pyramiden) than in the eggs from the Norwegian (Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund). Further on, the PCB congener composition in the eggs was comparable with the technical PCB-mixtures previous used in the Russian settlements. The results thus indicate influence of local pollution of PCB in eggs of snow buntings in the Russian settlements. Further on, local influence of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p -DDE) and PFASs cannot be excluded. However, the contaminant burden of hexachlorobenzen (HCB), trans-nonachlor, p,p -DDE and PFASs in the eggs of snow buntings in Svalbard are mainly explained by; I: atmospheric transport of contaminants to the Arctic environment, II: transport of contaminants by sea birds, III: exposure during migration, IV: exposure in overwintering areas. The concentration of organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) in eggs of snow buntings in this study is considerable lower than concentrations in previously studies that have reported to cause adverse effect in other bird species. Further are the concentrations of OHCs in this study in general lower when compared with other studies on Svalbard seabirds. However, it should be noted that the concentration of ∑PCB in eggs of snow buntings is comparable with previous studies on Svalbard seabirds. The results in this study indicate that the snow bunting may be utilized as a sentinel of local pollution in Svalbard in the future.",NA,NA,NA

They are widely used in a variety of consumer goods and industrial products because of their unique physico-chemical properties. Concern about fluorinated organic compounds, particularly the fully fluorinated PFCs, has been growing since the late 1990‟s because of their ubiquitous occurrence in the environment. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are representative and commonly occurring PFCs. The aims of the present PhD research project are to extend the current knowledge of PFC distribution in developing countries (i.e. India and South China), as well as to develop a new concept for understanding and explaining PFC pollution patterns by demonstrating the presence of unidentified organic fluorine-containing compounds in environmental samples other than PFCs. As part of this work, a new extraction method using acetonitrile (ACN) and solid phase extraction (SPE) and an ion exchange column to separate possible interferences from target PFCs was developed to improve PFC detection. The final goal of the project was to investigate the toxicity of several PFCs using laboratory studies. Two monitoring studies were conducted in South China and India. For the first one, concentrations and profiles of PFCs were investigated in surface waters (rivers, lakes, coastal seas and untreated sewage; n=42) including Ganges River water, and biota such as shrimp (n=2), fish (n=28), and the Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica; n=15) in India. PFOS was the dominant PFC found in most of the samples analyzed including water samples, with the exception of untreated sewage (water: <0.04-3.91 ng/L; biota: 0.248-27.9 ng/g wet weight (ww)) in India. Long-chain (C11-C18) perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) were not detected in the water samples (<0.2 ng/L), although perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) (0.061-0.923 ng/g ww) and perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) (0.072-0.998 ng/g ww) were found in biological samples. Overall, concentrations of PFCs in water and biological samples from India were lower than the concentrations reported for other countries so far. PFC profiles in Indian waters were dominated by PFOS, followed by PFOA, which differ from the pattern reported for other countries such as Korea, Japan and USA, where PFOA was the predominant compound in water samples. The second study measured the concentrations of 10 PFCs (PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamide (N-EtFOSA), N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate (NEtFOSAA), perfluorododecanoate (PFDoDA), PFUnDA, PFDA, perfluorononanoate (PFNA), PFOA, and perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA)) in liver samples of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis; n=10) and finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides; n=10) stranded in Hong Kong, South China, between 2003 and 2007. PFOS was found to be the dominant PFC in dolphin and porpoise tissues at concentrations ranging from 26-693 ng/g ww in dolphins and 51.3-262 ng/g ww in porpoises. The PFOS concentrations in liver samples were comparable to those reported in other studies on marine mammals. PFC composition profiles were similar between dolphins and porpoises: PFOS (75-83% of total PFCs), PFUnDA (10%), PFDA (3%) and PFNA (2%). In contrast, PFOSA contributed 5% of total PFCs in dolphin liver samples, whereas PFOSA only accounted for around 1% in porpoise liver samples, possibly due to different habitats and dietary habits between the two species. No significant correlations were found between PFC concentrations and other persistent environmental pollutants, namely total polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (and individual PBDE congeners) and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in the dolphin and porpoise samples. These results imply that the sources and the exposure pathways of PCBs/PBDEs and PFCs are likely to be different. Mass balance analysis was conducted by measuring total fluorine (TF) and extractable organic fluorine (EOF) in several types of environmental samples by combustion ion chromatography for fluorine. Human blood (n=30) from 6 cities in China was analyzed for TF analyses. Analysis of known PFCs and EOF showed that known PFCs accounted for >70% of EOF in Chinese human blood samples from Beijing, Shenyang and Guiyang, whereas known PFCs only accounted for around 30% of EOF in samples from Jintan. In wild animals, measurement of known PFCs and EOF in the marine mammal from South China (i.e. Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and finless porpoise) livers showed that a large proportion (~70%) of the organic fluorine in both species is of unknown origin. Wild rat blood was also used to further demonstrate the presence of unidentified organic fluorinecontaining compounds in terrestrial wild animals. The contribution of known PFCs to EOF varied from 9 to 89% (mean: 56%), suggesting that wild animals are exposed to a wider range of PFCs than humans. These investigations are critical for a comprehensive assessment of the risks of these compounds to humans and other receptors. Characterization and identification of these unidentified fluorinated compounds will be also instructive in terms of human and environmental risk assessment. Limitations of the currently used PFC-extraction method and the observation that unidentified organic fluorine-containing compounds were present in environmental samples led to the development of a better extraction method for PFCs in biota samples. A method using ACN extraction with SPE cleanup was developed which can be used to measure more than 28 perfluorinated compounds (perfluoroalkyl sulfonates: C4, C6, C8, C10; perfluoroalkyl sulfinates: C6, C8, C10; PFOSA, N-EtFOSA, N-EtFOSAA, perfluorocarboxylates: C4-C14; fluorotelomer carboxylates: 7:3, 8:2) in whole blood with recoveries ranging from 70-120%. This new method can extract and quantify more individual PFCs in whole blood samples than the concurrent ion pairing extraction method. As part of this method, separation of possible interferences such as taurodeoxycholic acid was accomplished using an ion exchange JJ50-2D column. In this project, toxicological and toxicokinetic parts are given to chickens because many other studies focused on mammalian species such as rats and monkeys. Health risk is also importance to avian species, however, these sources of information are limited. Two studies were conducted to extend the knowledge of possible health effects on chickens. These studies looked into the gene expression patterns and toxicokinetics of PFCs in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus) exposed in the laboratory. The effects of PFOS and PFOA on the gene expression patterns of chickens that were exposed to either compound at low doses were investigated with the use of microarray techniques. Twelve Genechip Chicken Genome Arrays were used to study hepatic gene expression in six-week-old chickens that were exposed to either PFOA (0.1, 0.5, or 5 mg/mL), PFOS (0.02 or 0.1 mg/mL), or a saline vehicle control (0.9% NaCl in Milli-Q water) via subcutaneous implantation of a 2 mL osmotic pump for four weeks or for four weeks with a further four weeks of depuration. The genes that were affected after four weeks of PFOS exposure were mainly related to the transport of electrons and oxygen and the metabolism of lipids and fatty acids, while the genes that were affected after four weeks of exposure with a further four weeks of depuration were mainly related to the transport of electrons and ions, and protein amino acid phosphorylation and proteolysis. The genes that were affected after four weeks of PFOA exposure were related to the transport of ions, lipids, and electrons and cytochromes, while the genes that were affected after four weeks of exposure with a further four weeks of depuration were related to protein amino acid phosphorylation and proteolysis, the transport of ions, and the metabolism of fatty acids and lipids. The results also showed that the gene expression patterns between chickens that were treated with PFOS and those that were treated with PFOA were different, which points to the importance of the separate evaluation of the toxicities of PFOS and PFOA. The other toxicity study examined the effects of exposure of one-day-old male chicks to mixtures of PFOS, PFOA, and PFDA at either a low dose (0.1 mg/kg body weight (bw)) or a high dose (1.0 mg/kg bw), or a saline/ethanol vehicle control via oral gavage thrice a week for three weeks. After three weeks of exposure, half of the chicks were sacrificed and the other half were allowed to depurate for a further three weeks. No dose-dependent statistically significant differences in body/organ weights were observed among treatment and control groups after three weeks of exposure or after three weeks of depuration. Neither 15 histological nor 14 plasma biochemical parameters were significantly different in chicks from the exposed groups and vehicle controls. PFOS and PFDA accumulated at much higher concentrations than PFOA in blood/liver/kidney during the experimental periods. The half-lives for each PFC at the 0.1 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg doses were, respectively, approximately 15 and 17 days for PFOS, 11 and 16 days for PFDA, and 3.9 and 3.9 days for PFOA. These results indicated that exposure to 1.0 mg mixture of PFOS/PFDA/PFOA/kg bw has no adverse effects on the endpoints measured in juvenile chickens. Future research directions are given at the end of this thesis. In the present project, only PFCAs and PFASs were evaluated in different environmental matrices. PFCs (C2-C3) could be detected as high as PFOS or PFOA in environmental samples, however, the recoveries were less than 10%. Effort should be made to development methods to determine these PFCs in the environmental samples. In addition, other precursors like FTOHs, FOSAs, FOSEs, and other new PFCs like PAPs are getting much attention because they are thought to be degraded to PFCAs or PFASs. Tracing these precursors can identify whether these chemicals are major sources of these PFCAs or PFASs. Biomagnifications of PFCs had been evaluated in aquatic food web, however, biomagnifications of EOF and the patterns of EOF and known PFCs should be carried out to have a broader analysis of the accumulation and transfer of fluorine compounds in the environment. The characterization of this unknown organic fluorine should be conducted. ; CityU Call Number: QD305.H15 Y48 2009 ; xxi, 239 leaves : ill. 30 cm. ; Thesis (Ph.D.)--City University of Hong Kong, 2009. ; Includes bibliographical references (leaves 211-239)",NA,NA,NA

The two main point sources of environmental contamination of PFAS are releases from manufacturing facilities and from the use of firefighting foams at fire training facilities, airports, military bases, and fire suppression sites. Two potential point sources of PFAS in College Station, TX occur along White Creek: the Brayton Fire Training Field (BFTF) and the Easterwood Airport. The goal of this ecological risk assessment is to determine the magnitude and effects that PFAS coming from these two sources may pose on the reproductive success of Carolina Wrens, an indicator species for invertivorous birds. Field-collected concentrations of PFAS around the facilities and literature-based equations and values were used to assist in the estimation of exposure of PFAS to Carolina Wrens. Specifically, a total daily intake value of PFOS (0.006 mgPFOS/kgbody/day) was calculated and then compared to a lab-derived no-observed-adverse-effect-level (0.77 mgPFOS/kgbody/day) from the literature to yield a risk quotient (0.008). The risk quotient in this ecological risk assessment was well below 1, indicating that PFOS does not represent a risk for negative effects on the reproduction of Carolina Wrens nesting around the Easterwood Airport and Brayton Fire Training Field.",NA,NA,NA

Research over the last 20 years has shown that these compounds are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, extremely persistent, show toxic effects and accumulate in the food web. Pollution research in the Arctic has traditionally focused on long range transport (LRT), but local pollution from historical and present day human activities also constitute important pollution sources in the Arctic. The overall aim of the present study was to examine if the use of PFASs in AFFFs at Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund airport may constitute a local source of contamination and contribute to the bioaccumulation of PFASs in terrestrial biota in Svalbard. Thus, eggs of snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) were collected along a transect from Longyearbyen airport towards Adventdalen and around the airport in Ny-Ålesund in 2016. A total of 11 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), 9 perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and 2 fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTSs) were detected in the egg content from snow buntings. Sum22 PFAS concentrations increased significantly from Adventdalen towards Longyearbyen and Longyearbyen airport. Sum22 PFAS concentrations in Ny-Ålesund were within the same range as Longyearbyen. Overall perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) comprised the majority of the contamination burden and was found at highest concentrations at all four locations. PFCAs and PFSAs with carbon chain lengths of five or less were not detected. Linear PFOS (linPFOS) constituted 78-96.5% of total PFOS in snow bunting eggs. The linPFOS comprised 78.7% and 78.4% at Longyearbyen airport and Longyearbyen, respectively, which were within range of the PFOS electrochemical fluorination (ECF) production standard for AFFFs (76-79% linPFOS) and indicative of a local point source. Adventdalen (89.9%) and Ny-Ålesund (96.5%) had a higher linPFOS percentage indicative of LRT or exposure to old legacy PFAS sources. The levels of PFASs in snow buntings at Longyearbyen airport were 12-90 times higher compared to the other locations. The PFAS levels at this location were above toxicity threshold described in the literature for possible sensitive bird species and are therefore of toxicological concern. Future studies should elucidate whether or not the snow bunting is a sensitive species with respect to adverse effects of PFASs. The present study show that the eggs from snow buntings living in the proximity of Longyearbyen airport are contaminated with PFAS, indicating the fire fighting training facilities at Longyearbyen airport as a point source of PFASs for the local biota that contribute to the bioaccumulation of PFASs in snow buntings residing here. Ny-Ålesund differed from the other locations with respect to the PFSA:PFCA profile and the linPFOS:brPFOS profile, indicating a different source of exposure compared to the other locations. Further investigation for possible sources in the Ny-Ålesund area is therefore recommended.",NA,NA,NA

Previous small scale studies found high concentrations of POPs in adult great skuas, Stercorarius skua, a top predator in the marine environment. This thesis investigates the factors affecting concentrations and patterns of POPs (contribution of individual POPs to the ΣPOPs) in the great skua across its breeding range in the north-east Atlantic. Clear differences between colonies in both concentration and pattern of POPs in adult plasma were not indicative of being caused by long range transport of POPs in the atmosphere. Variation in diet between colonies is the mostly likely explanation for these colony differences, with great skuas from some colonies having a greater proportion of fish in their diet whilst others eat more seabird prey. Although seabirds are often used in studies of POPs in the environment, the effect of migratory behaviour has not previously been studied in detail. By using a combination of global location sensor (GLS) loggers and feather stable isotopes from winter grown feathers, the wintering areas of individuals from three breeding populations of great skuas were identified. Great skuas spend the winter in three distinct areas across the North Atlantic, with birds from the same breeding colonies wintering in different areas. In two of the three breeding populations, wintering area explained a significant proportion of variation in organochlorines (OCs) concentrations and pattern. However in the colony with the highest concentrations of OCs, no effect of wintering area was found, possibly as a result of these great skuas feeding at a higher trophic level during the breeding season than other populations. Temporally, concentrations of OCs were higher in 1980 than 2008 in eggs, whilst newer contaminants polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFASs) show the opposite trend. In conclusion, concentrations of POPs in the great skua were influenced primarily by breeding season diet with wintering area and sex also having small but significant effects on POPs. Wintering area explained the most variation in the pattern of POPs in great skuas. The POP concentrations found in this study exceeded those which have been found to cause adverse effects on the immune system and reproduction in other species of seabird.",NA,NA,NA

Disse organiske halogenerte miljøgiftene (OHCene) har blitt relatert til effekter på organismers tyroidhormon (TH)-homeostase, noe som skaper bekymring med tanke på de potensielle effektene på både individ- og populasjonsnivå. Polarmåken (Larus hyperboreus) er en av toppredatorene i Arktis som akkumulerer høye OHC-nivåer, og populasjonsstørrelsen på Bjørnøya, Svalbard, har gått ned drastisk de siste tiårene. I motsetning har populasjonsstørrelsen i Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, økt og er nå stabil. Målet med dette studiet var å undersøke PCB-, OCP-, og PFAS-konsentrasjoner, og deres effekter på total og fri tyroksin og trijodtyronin (TT4, FT4, TT3, og FT3, respektivt)-konsentrasjoner og -ratio i blodplasma av polarmåker i disse to populasjonene i løpet av 2015 – 2019 perioden. Dette for å vurdere om TH-forstyrrende effekter bidrar til populasjonsnedgangen på Bjørnøya. Polarmåker fra Bjørnøya hadde veldig høye OHC-konsentrasjoner sammenlignet med fuglene fra Kongsfjorden i løpet av femårsperioden. I begge populasjonene hadde hunfuglene lavere OHC-konsentrasjoner enn hanfuglene, noe som indikerer at hunfugler kan kvitte seg med OHCer via overføring av miljøgifter fra mor til egg. Ingen lokalitetsforskjeller ble funnet i noen av TH-konsentrasjonene eller -ratio, og bare FT3-konsentrasjoner og FT4/FT3-ratio var signifikant forskjellig mellom kjønn innad i hver lokalitet. Disse resultatene indikerte at de høye OHC-konsentrasjonene ikke påvirket TH-nivåene i disse fuglene. Prinsipal komponent analyser (PCAer) som inkluderte begge lokaliteter støttet dette funnet, mens lineære blandet-effekt modeller (LMMer) indikerte positive effekter av PFASer på TH-konsentrasjoner, men ikke på TH-ratio, på tvers av de to populasjonene. Lokalitet, prøvetakingsår, kjønn, kroppskondisjonsindeks (BCI), og lipidvektprosent i plasma var andre variabler som bidro i variasjonen i TH-nivåene. Ingen effekt av PCBer og OCPer ble funnet. Resultatene av dette studiet foreslår at disse polarmåkene ikke har blitt signifikant påvirket av TH-forstyrrende effekter forårsaket av eksponering for forurensning, og at TH-forstyrrende effekter trolig ikke bidrar i populasjonsnedgangen på Bjørnøya. Derimot så er TH-nivåene regulert av tyroidstimulerende hormon (TSH), og det bør ikke utelukkes at fuglene kunne opprettholde relativt konstante TH-nivåer til tross for den mulige TH-forstyrrende effekten av PFASer. Det bør understrekes at prøver ble tatt fra hekkende, og dermed relativt friske individer. Fremtidige studier burde derfor vurdere å inkludere individer i tidligere livsstadier og ikke-hekkende individer for å kunne utelukke at prøvetakingen er forutinntatt, analogt til «Healthy Worker Effect» fenomenet (HWE; sunne arbeider-effekten). ; Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), and per- and polyfluoralkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in the pristine Arctic, despite many of them being globally restricted or banned. These organohalogenated contaminants (OHCs) have been related to effects on the thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis in organisms, causing concern of their potential effects on both individual and population level. The glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) is one of the top predators in the Arctic accumulating high OHC levels, and the population size on Bjørnøya, Svalbard, has decreased drastically during the past decades. In contrast, the population size in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, has increased and is now stable. To assess whether TH disruptive effects could have contributed to the population decline on Bjørnøya, the present study aimed to investigate the PCB, OCP, and PFAS concentrations, and their effects on the total and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine (TT4, FT4, TT3, and FT3, respectively) concentrations and ratios in blood plasma of glaucous gulls in these two populations during the 2015 – 2019 period. Glaucous gulls from Bjørnøya had very high OHC concentrations compared to the birds from Kongsfjorden throughout the five-year period. In both populations, female birds had lower OHC concentrations compared to males, indicating that females can get rid of OHCs through maternal transfer of contaminants to the eggs. No differences in neither of the TH concentrations nor ratios were observed between locations, and only FT3 concentrations and FT4/FT3 ratios differed between sexes in both locations. These results indicated that the high OHC concentrations did not alter the TH levels in these birds. Principal component analyses (PCAs) including both locations supported these findings, while linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) indicated positive effects of PFASs on the TH concentrations, but not on the TH ratios, across the two populations. Other variables that contributed to the variation in the TH concentrations were location, sampling year, sex, body condition index (BCI), and plasma lipid weight percentage. No effects of PCBs and OCPs were found. The results from the present study suggest that these glaucous gulls do not experience significant TH disruptive effects caused by pollutant exposure, and that TH disruptive effects are most likely not contributing to the population decline on Bjørnøya. However, the TH levels are regulated by the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and it cannot be disregarded that the birds were able to maintain relatively constant TH levels despite of the possible TH disruptive effect of PFASs. It should be emphasised that samples were obtained from breeding, and thereby relatively healthy individuals. To be able to rule out biased sampling, analogous to the Healthy Worker Effect (HWE) phenomenon, future studies should consider including early life-stage and non-breeding individuals.",NA,NA,NA

Studies conducted on waterbirds in the past 15 years indicate that organochlorine contaminants have declined in eggs and tissues, although p,p'-DDE, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coplanar PCB congeners may still exert sublethal and reproductive effects in some locations. There have been numerous reports of avian die-off events related to organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides. More contemporary contaminants (e.g., alkylphenols, ethoxylates, perfluorinated compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) are detectable in bird eggs in the most industrialized portions of the Bay, but interpretation of these data is difficult because adverse effect levels are incompletely known for birds. Two moderate-sized oil spills resulted in the death of several hundred birds, and about 500 smaller spill events occur annually in the watershed. With the exception of lead, concentrations of cadmium, mercury, and selenium in eggs and tissues appear to be below toxic thresholds for waterbirds. Fishing tackle and discarded plastics, that can entangle and kill young and adults, are prevalent in nests in some Bay tributaries. It is apparent that exposure and potential effects of several classes of contaminants (e.g., dioxins, dibenzofurans, rodenticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, lead shot, and some metals) have not been systematically examined in the past 15 years, highlighting the need for toxicological evaluation of birds found dead, and perhaps an avian ecotoxicological monitoring program. Although oil spills, spent lead shot, some pesticides, and industrial pollutants occasionally harm Chesapeake avifauna, contaminants no longer evoke the population level effects that were observed in Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) and Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) through the 1970s.",NA,NA,NA

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in nestling stomach contents and perfluorinated compound concentrations in nestling plasma at 67% and 64% of AOCs, respectively, were below the mean concentration for non-AOCs. Concentrations of PCBs in nestling carcasses were elevated at some AOCs but modest compared with highly PCB-contaminated sites where reproductive effects have been documented. Concentrations of PAHs in diet were sufficiently elevated at some AOCs to elicit a measurable physiological response. Among AOCs, concentrations of the perfluorinated compound perfluorooctane sulfonate in plasma were the highest on the River Raisin (MI, USA; geometric mean 330 ng/mL) but well below an estimated toxicity reference value (1700 ng/mL). Both PAH and PCB concentrations in nestling stomach contents and PCBs in carcasses were significantly correlated with concentrations in sediment previously reported, thereby reinforcing the utility of tree swallows to assess bioavailability of sediment contamination.

PFOS and PFOA were also confirmed developing toxicants towards zebrafish embryos; however, the reported effect concentrations were contradictory. Polyfluorinated alkylated phosphate ester surfactants (including FC807) are precursor of PFOS and PFOA; however, there is no published information about the effects of FC807 and PFNA on zebrafish embryos. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of these four PFCs on zebrafish embryos. Normal fertilized zebrafish embryos were selected to be exposed to several concentrations of PFOA, PFNA, PFOS or FC807 in 24-well cell culture plates. A digital camera was used to image morphological anomalies of embryos with a stereomicroscope. Embryos were observed through matching up to 96-h post-fertilization (hpf) and rates of survival and abnormalities recorded. PFCs caused lethality in a concentration-dependent manner with potential toxicity in the order of PFOS > FC807 > PFNA > PFOA based on 72-h LC50. Forty-eight-hour post-fertilization pericardial edema and 72- or 96-hpf spine crooked malformation were all observed.

The herring gull (Larus argentatus) is a generalist with a broad range of dietary sources, possibly introducing a weakness in its representativeness of aquatic contamination. To investigate the herring gull as an indicator of contamination in an urban-influenced fjord, the Norwegian Oslofjord, we compared concentrations of a range of lipophilic and protein-associated organohalogen contaminants (OHCs), Hg, and dietary markers in blood (n = 15), and eggs (n = 15) between the herring gull and the strict marine-feeding common eider(Somateria mollissima)in the breeding period of May 2017. Dietary markers showed that the herring gull was less representative of the marine food web than the common eider. We found higher concentrations of lipophilic OHCs (wet weight and lipid weight) and Hg (dry weight) in the blood of common eider (mean +/- SE n-ary sumation PCB = 210 +/- 126 ng/g ww, 60 600 +/- 28 300 ng/g lw; mean Hg = 4.94 +/- 0.438 ng/g dw) than of the herring gull (mean +/- SE n-ary sumation PCB = 19.0 +/- 15.6 ng/g ww, 1210 +/- 1510 ng/g lw; mean Hg = 4.26 +/- 0.438 ng/g dw). Eggs gave opposite results; higher wet weight and lipid weight OHC concentrations in the herring gull (mean +/- SE n-ary sumation PCB = 257 +/- 203 ng/g ww, 3240 +/- 2610 ng/g lw) than the common eider (mean +/- SE n-ary sumation PCB = 18.2 +/- 20.8 ng/g ww, 101 +/- 121 ng/g lw), resulting in higher OHC maternal transfer ratios in gulls than eiders. We suggest that the matrix differences are due to fasting during incubation in the common eider. We suggest that in urban areas, herring gull might not be representative as an indicator of marine contamination but rather urban contaminant exposure. The common eider is a better indicator of marine pollution in the Oslofjord. The results are influenced by the matrix choice, as breeding strategy affects lipid dynamics regarding the transfer of lipids and contaminants to eggs and remobilization of contaminants from lipids to blood during incubation, when blood is drawn from the mother. Our results illustrate the benefit of a multispecies approach for a thorough picture of contaminant status in urban marine ecosystems.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-12.

Concentrations of PFASs were quantified as were reproductive success end points. The sample egg method was used wherein an egg sample is collected, and the hatching success of the remaining eggs in the nest is assessed. The association between PFAS exposure and reproductive success was assessed by site comparisons, logistic regression analysis, and multistate modeling, a technique not previously used in this context. There was a negative association between concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in eggs and hatching success. The concentration at which effects became evident (150-200 ng/g wet weight) was far lower than effect levels found in laboratory feeding trials or egg-injection studies of other avian species. This discrepancy was likely because behavioral effects and other extrinsic factors are not accounted for in these laboratory studies and the possibility that tree swallows are unusually sensitive to PFASs. The results from multistate modeling and simple logistic regression analyses were nearly identical. Multistate modeling provides a better method to examine possible effects of additional covariates and assessment of models using Akaike information criteria analyses. There was a credible association between PFOS concentrations in plasma and eggs, so extrapolation between these two commonly sampled tissues can be performed.",NA,NA,NA

Here, we provide an update on the state of the knowledge of OHC, and also include mercury, exposure and/or associated effects in key Arctic marine and terrestrial mammal and bird species as well as in fish by reviewing the literature published since the last AMAP assessment in 2010. We aimed at updating the knowledge of how single but also combined health effects are or can be associated to the exposure to single compounds or mixtures of OHCs. We also focussed on assessing both potential individual as well as population health impacts using population-specific exposure data post 2000. We have identified quantifiable effects on vitamin metabolism, immune functioning, thyroid and steroid hormone balances, oxidative stress, tissue pathology, and reproduction. As with the previous assessment, a wealth of documentation is available for biological effects in marine mammals and seabirds, and sentinel species such as the sledge dog and Arctic fox, but information for terrestrial vertebrates and fish remain scarce. While hormones and vitamins are thoroughly studied, oxidative stress, immunotoxic and reproductive effects need further investigation. Depending on the species and population, some OHCs and mercury tissue contaminant burdens post 2000 were observed to be high enough to exceed putative risk threshold levels that have been previously estimated for non-target species or populations outside the Arctic. In this assessment, we made use of risk quotient calculations to summarize the cumulative effects of different OHC classes and mercury for which critical body burdens can be estimated for wildlife across the Arctic. As our ultimate goal is to better predict or estimate the effects of OHCs and mercury in Arctic wildlife at the individual, population and ecosystem level, there remain numerous knowledge gaps on the biological effects of exposure in Arctic biota. These knowledge gaps include the establishment of concentration thresholds for individual compounds as well as for realistic cocktail mixtures that in fact indicate biologically relevant, and not statistically determined, health effects for specific species and subpopulations. Finally, we provide future perspectives on understanding Arctic wildlife health using new in vivo, in vitro, and in silico techniques, and provide case studies on multiple stressors to show that future assessments would benefit from significant efforts to integrate human health, wildlife ecology and retrospective and forecasting aspects into assessing the biological effects of OHC and mercury exposure in Arctic wildlife and fish.

PBDE congeners, which are comprised of technical mixtures such as DE-71, are globally persistent and their concentrations are increasing in many species. Captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were exposed by diet to vehicle (safflower oil), or one of two environmentally relevant concentrations of DE-71 and unintentionally to HBCD. This exposure resulted in the birds laying eggs that contain PBDE and HBCD concentrations currently found in wild herring gull (Larus argentatus) and peregrine falcon (F peregrinus) eggs, and compared to control kestrels, resulted in delayed egg laying and smaller eggs being laid, caused thinner eggshells and differential weight loss during embryonic development, and reduced fertility and reproductive success. The thickness of the eggshell declined as the concentrations of all measured PBDE and the total amount of alpha-HBCD congeners (except BDE-183 and BDE-209) increased; increasing concentrations of BDE-153, BDE-154, BDE-28, BDE-17, delayed egg laying, reduced eggshell mass (plus Sigma PBDEs), and reduced fledging success (BDE-153 and BDE-154 only).

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are found in birds throughout the world, but relatively little is known of their concentrations or effects in free-living terrestrial passerines. We used a nest box population of European starlings to 1) measure the variation in egg concentrations of persistent organohalogen contaminants at an agricultural site, and 2) assess whether individual variation in PBDE concentrations in eggs was related to reproductive parameters, as well as maternal or nestling characteristics including body condition, thyroid hormones, oxidative stress, and hematocrit. As PBDEs were the main contaminant class of interest, we only assessed a subset of eggs for other organohalogen contaminants to establish background concentrations. Exposure to organohalogen contaminants was extremely variable over this relatively small study area. Geometric mean wet weight concentrations (range in brackets) of the major contaminants were 36.5 (12-174) ng/g Sigma DDT (n = 6 eggs) and 10.9 (2-307) ng/g Sigma PBDEs (n = 14). Sigma PCBs at 3.58 (1.5-6.4) ng/g (n = 6) were lower and less variable. There were low levels of other organochlorine (0C) pesticides such as dieldrin (2.02 ng/g), chlordanes (1.11 ng/g) and chlorobenzenes (0.23 ng/g). The only form of DDT detected was p,p'-DDE. The congener profiles of PBDEs and PCBs reflect those of industrial mixtures (i.e. DE-71, Aroclors 1254, 1260 and 1262). For all of the contaminant classes, concentrations detected in eggs at our study site were below levels previously reported to cause effects. Due to small sample sizes, we did not assess the relationship between Sigma PCBs or Sigma OCs and adult or chick condition. We observed no correlative relationships between individual variation in PBDE concentrations in starling eggs and reproductive success, maternal condition, or nestling condition in the corresponding nests.

Reduced productivity, eggshell thinning, and high DDE concentrations in eggs were the signs associated with declining osprey populations in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The species was one of the first studied on a large scale to bring contaminant issues into focus. Although few quantitative population data were available prior to the 1960s, many osprey populations in North America were studied during the 1960s and 1970s with much learned about basic life history and biology. This article reviews the historical and current effects of contaminants on regional osprey populations. Breeding populations in many regions of North America showed post-DDT-era (1972) population increases of varying magnitudes, with many populations now appearing to stabilize at much higher numbers than initially reported in the 1970s and 1980s. However, the magnitude of regional population increases in the United States between 1981 (first Nationwide Survey, 8,000 pairs), when some recovery had already occurred, 1994 (second survey, 14,200), and 2001 (third survey, 16,000-19,000), or any other years, is likely not a simple response to the release from earlier contaminant effects, but a response to multi-factorial effects. This indirect ocontaminant effectso measurement comparing changes (i.e., recovery) in post-DDT-era population numbers over time is probably confounded by changing human attitudes toward birds of prey (shooting, destroying nests, etc.), changing habitats, changing fish populations, and perhaps competition from other species. The species' adaptation to newly created reservoirs and its increasing use of artificial nesting structures (power poles, nesting platforms, cell towers, channel markers, offshore duck blinds, etc.) are two important factors. The timing of the initial use of artificial nesting structures, which replaced declining numbers of suitable trees at many locations, varied regionally (much later in the western United States and Mexico). Because of the increasing use of artificial nesting structures, there may be more ospreys nesting in North America now than ever before. Now, with the impact of most legacy organic contaminants (DDT, other organochlorine [OC] pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCB], polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins [PCDD], polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF]) greatly reduced or eliminated, and some osprey populations showing evidence of stabilizing, the species was proposed as a Worldwide Sentinel Species for evaluating emerging contaminants. Several emerging contaminants are already being studied, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluorinated acids and sulfonate compounds (PFC). The many advantages for continued contaminant investigations using the osprey include a good understanding of its biology and ecology, its known distribution and abundance, and its ability to habituate to humans and their activities, which permits nesting in some of the potentially most contaminated environments. It is a top predator in most ecosystems, and its nests are relatively easy to locate and study with little researcher impact on reproductive success.",NA,NA,NA

Total PBDE concentrations in great blue heron eggs from Indiana Dunes were elevated and probably reflect local contamination from highly urbanized and industrialized inputs into Lake Michigan.

It is believed that the pituitary hormone prolactin plays an important role in such allocation processes. Incubation does not solely imply the active warming of the eggs but also the active egg-turning to facilitate absorption of albumen by the embryo, reduce malposition and prevent the embryo from adhering to the inner shell membrane. However, how prolactin secretion is related to egg-turning behaviors is presently poorly addressed. In addition, several environmental contaminants can affect parental care behaviors through their endocrine disrupting properties but the effects of such contaminants on egg-turning behaviors remain so far unexplored. Using artificial eggs equipped with miniaturized data loggers, we investigated the relationships between egg-turning behaviors, prolactin secretion and contaminants burden in Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Specifically, we examined the relationships between blood concentrations of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorines (OCs), mercury (Hg), plasma prolactin levels and both egg-turning frequency and angular change. We also incorporated baseline corticosterone levels since this glucocorticoid is known to affect parental care. Plasma prolactin levels were positively related to angular change in female kittiwakes while corticosterone was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. Hg was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. We found contrasting associations between OCs and PFASs, since polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were negatively associated with angular change in females, contrary to linear perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOSIin) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) which were positively related to egg-turning frequency and angular change in both sexes. Additionally, PFASs concentrations were positively related to prolactin levels in female kittiwake. The possible stimulation of prolactin secretion by PFASs could therefore make adult kittiwakes to allocate more time taking care of their eggs, and thus possibly modify the trade-off between spending enough time caring for the clutch and obtaining enough nutrients at sea.",NA,NA,NA

Biomarkers (retinoids, thyroid hormones, and clinical parameters) and contaminants (organochlorine contaminants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and mercury (Hg)) were analyzed in blood, and Hg was analyzed in feathers (generally 9 nestlings per colony and 4 colonies per year). Feather Hg and most contaminants detected in blood were found in higher concentrations in birds from freshwater than estuarine colonies more distant from the pollution sources. Among freshwater colonies, Ile aux Hérons showed the highest levels of contaminants, with mean Hg concentrations of 8.4 and 0.55 mg/kg in feathers and plasma, respectively, and plasma ΣBFRs of 19.6 ng/g ww. The highest mean ΣPCBs, 56.5 ng/g ww, was measured at Grande Ile in 2001. The levels of contaminants in heron nestlings were generally below critical thresholds for adverse effects observed on reproduction or survival. Retinol, dehydroretinol (DROH), and thyroid hormone concentrations differed significantly among colonies. Retinol concentrations were negatively related to ΣPCBs, whereas DROH concentrations were negatively related to Hg and total and free triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were negatively related to ΣBFRs. These results indicate that contaminants from the St. Lawrence River could impair the development and fitness of great blue heron nestlings and emphasize the need for more research on the great blue heron population to assess their health and nutritional status. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cited By :8

In 2000 and 2001, contaminant exposure and reproduction were monitored in ospreys nesting in regions of concern, including Baltimore Harbor and the Patapsco River, the Anacostia and middle Potomac rivers, and the Elizabeth River, and a presumed reference site consisting of the South, West, and Rhode rivers. A ""sample egg"" from each study nest was collected for contaminant analysis, and the fate of eggs remaining in each nest (n = 14-16/site) was monitored at 7- to 10-day intervals from egg incubation through fledging of young. Ospreys fledged young in regions of concern (observed success: 0.88-1.53 fledglings/active nest), although productivity was marginal for sustaining local populations in Baltimore Harbor and the Patapsco River and in the Anacostia and middle Potomac rivers. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE and many other organochlorine pesticides or metabolites, total PCBs, some arylhydrocarbon receptor-active PCB congeners and polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners, and perfluorooctanesulfonate were often greater in sample eggs from regions of concern compared to the reference site. Nonetheless, logistic regression analyses did not provide evidence linking marginal productivity to p,p'-DDE, total PCBs, or arylhydrocarbon receptor-active PCB congener exposure in regions of concern. In view of the moderate concentrations of total PCBs in eggs from the reference site, concerns related to new and emerging toxicants, and the absence of ecotoxicological data for terrestrial vertebrates in many Bay, tributaries, a more thorough spatial evaluation of contaminant exposure in ospreys throughout the Chesapeake may be warranted.",NA,NA,NA

Contaminants were already determined in eggs from Canada (Seymour Island; except PFASs), Svalbard in Norway (SvenskOya), and 3 sites in Russia (Nagurskoe, Cape Klyuv, and Domashny). New data from Greenland allowed the investigation of a possible longitudinal gradient of contamination. The most quantitatively abundant OCs were p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorobiphenyls. Mercury concentrations were higher in Canada compared with other colonies. Eggs from Nagurskoe often were characterized by higher OC and BFR concentrations. Concentrations gradually decreased in colonies situated east of Nagurskoe. In contrast, PFAS concentrations, especially perfluorooctanoate and perfluorononanoate, were higher in Greenland. Some of the contaminants, especially Hg and p,p-DDE, exceeded published thresholds known to disrupt the reproductive success of avian species. Overall, the levels of OCs, BFRs, and PFASs did not suggest direct lethal exposure to these compounds, but their potential synergetic/additive sublethal effects warrant monitoring.

Biometric indices for damage caused by pollutants such as the shell thickness and the shell index were determined and the egg contents were analyzed for various pollutants by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A wide range of chemically activated luciferase expression (CALUX(R)) bioassays were performed on subsamples of the eggs.        The following organohalogen compounds were found in the eggs of 2009: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene, dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexane, polychlorobiphenyls and polychlorodibenzodioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans, polybromodiphenyl ethers, hexabromocyclododecane, tetrabromobisphenyl A, perfluoro compounds, and mercury. The DDT metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) (11,800 ng/g dry matter), was found to be the most highly concentrated egg contaminant followed by 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (3800 ng/g). After a past general drop in pollution level, most egg contaminants presently plateau at levels that may still exceed limit values in foods of animal origin (DDE) or even toxicological thresholds (polychlorobiphenyls C polychlorodibenzodioxins, polybromodiphenyl ethers, perfluorooctanesulfonate, methylmercury).        Accumulation of DDE could be shown in peregrine falcon eggs from the uplands of Southwest Germany with elevations up to 1500 m, presumably due to its global distribution and its cold condensation in higher altitudes. In contrast, the concentration of polychlorobiphenyls in falcon eggs decreases with elevation, indicating that these pollutants originate mainly from conurbations and local industrial sites.        Significant negative correlations were found between both shell index and thickness and the concentration of Hg. A deleterious effect is also evident from a no-observed-adverse-effect level of 120 ng MeHg per gram egg determined by other authors in chronic feeding studies with ibises, which resulted in decreased egg productivity and male homosexual nesting and courtship behavior. The average Hg concentration in the peregrine falcon eggs from 2009 is almost four times higher than this level. MeHg accounted for 82.5% of the Hg present in the eggs of 2009 and 2010.        The cell test DR CALUX(R) for screening of dioxin-like activities can be used to detect not only the 29 regulated dioxin-like substances but also many other persistent organic pollutants with dioxin-like potencies, such as mixed halogenated dioxins/biphenyls. In our case, the results of bioanalytical screening methods showed no additional effect of other compounds with dioxin-like activity.        Ninety-three out of 177 analytes sought could be detected in the eggs. Chlorinated paraffins, organotin compounds, some pesticides that are still in use, and phthalic esters with the exception of traces of diethylhexyl phthalate could be excluded.

One might then identify the cause and pave the way for a mitigating response. The toxicant component of DABSE is being examined at the low ng ml(-1) level in 200 mu l of whole blood.

Most contaminants declined significantly over time in most regions. Globally, the highest annual change, - 17.5%, was found for pp'-DDD, while the smallest annual decline, -0.54%, was observed for Hg. Concentrations of Sigma DDT and Sigma FR8 (sum of 8 congeners) decreased by -11.6% and -7.3%, respectively. Declines in Sigma PCBs differed among regions, from-5.6% in the fluvial section to-14.7% in the inland region. The highest concentration of Sigma FR8 was measured in eggs from Grande Ile in the fluvial section of the river in 1996 (2.39 mu g/g). Stable isotope ratios also showed temporal trends in some regions: delta C-13 decreased in the fluvial section and increased in Gulf region, while delta N-15 decreased in the fluvial section and increased in the upper estuary. Significant positive relationships were found between Sigma DDT, Sigma PCBs and Sigma FRs and delta N-15 and delta C-13 in freshwater colonies, but not in estuarine or marine colonies.

Although several reports have reviewed PBDE contamination in general, none have focused specifically on birds. Birds have long been recognized as invaluable monitoring species for organohalogen contamination. This review summarizes most available PBDE data in birds and emphasizes several specific aspects, i.e., inter-regional differences in PBDE contamination, the extent of BDE-209 contamination, differences in congener composition patterns between piscivorous and terrestrial-feeding birds, trophic biomagnification and temporal changes in PBDE contamination. A meta-analysis of PBDE congener profiles reveals distinctly different patterns between birds utilizing terrestrial and aquatic food webs. Terrestrial-feeding birds appear to exhibit heightened Deca-BDE contamination. Inter-regional comparisons reveal elevated PBDE burdens in North American aquatic birds compared to those from the rest of the world, likely related to greater Penta-BDE demand there. Examination of North American and Chinese terrestrial birds also exhibited some of the highest BDE-209 concentrations ever reported in wildlife, and suggested that urban environments in general and some commercial activities (e.g., electronic recycling) may increase exposure of wildlife and humans to Deca-BDE. Summaries of temporal trend studies suggest that varying usage histories and regulations have influenced PBDE contamination patterns at different regions. As a consequence of continued usage of Deca-BDE around the world, significant increases in BDE-209 burdens have been observed in both North American and European birds. Examination of both wild and laboratory-exposed birds also indicated potential degradation of BDE-209 to less brominated, but more bioavailable/toxic congeners. Therefore, it would be wise to reduce releases of Deca-BDE, the only PBDE formulation remaining in production, to the environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Concentrations of 11 PFCs (PFOS, PFHxS, PFBS, PFOSA, PFDoDA, PFUnDA, PFDA, PFNA, PFOA, PFHpA, PFHxA) were measured in night heron, great egret, and little egret eggs from South China (Hong Kong, Xiamen, Quanzhou). PFOS was found to be the dominant PFC in the waterbird eggs. Total concentrations of the 11 PFCs in waterbind eggs ranged from 27.0 ng/g ww (great egret from Hong Kong) to 160 ng/g ww (night heron from Quanzhou). Significant differences in PFOS concentrations were found among species, but not among locations. The composition profiles of the individual PFCs among egg samples were generally similar. Positive correlations were found between PFOS and some of the PFCAs in the egg samples from Hong Kong. Concentrations of some of the PFCs were significantly correlated with total PCB concentrations reported in a previous study in the night heron egg samples, but not in the great egret samples.

They contaminate both freshwater and marine ecosystems, are highly persistent, and accumulate through trophic transfer. Seabirds are exposed to environmental contaminants due to their high trophic position in food webs and relatively long lifespan. We measured levels of 10 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in egg yolks of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) breeding in the northern Adriatic Sea (Northeast Italy). We examined variations in PFAAs within clutches (between eggs of different laying order) and among clutches. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant yolk PFAA (mean = 42.0 ng/g wet wt), followed by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; 3.8 ng/g wet wt) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDa; 2.8 ng/g wet wt). The n-ary sumation PFAAs averaged 57.4 ng/g wet weight, ranging between 26.5 and 115.0 ng/g wet weight. The PFAA levels varied substantially among clutches (0.29-0.79 of the total variation), whereas the effects of laying order were considerably weaker (0.01-0.13). Egg-laying order effects were detected for n-ary sumation PFAAs, PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and PFDoDa, whereby the last-laid eggs exhibited lower PFAA concentrations than early-laid eggs. Our results indicate that seagulls from the northern Adriatic basin deposit measurable amounts of PFAAs in their eggs.

In the present study we examined the associations between the concentrations of 4 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and 11 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in the eggs of great tits (Parus major), collected along a distance gradient from a pollution source, and multiple reproductive parameters (including the start of egg laying, clutch size, hatching success, fledging success and total breeding success) along with egg shell thickness and body condition of the nestlings. The PFAA concentrations measured at the plant site were among the highest ever reported in wild bird eggs. PFAA concentrations decreased sharply with increasing distance (0-11 km) from the plant, but remained relatively elevated in the adjacent sites. PFAAs were grouped into principal components (PCs) to prevent collinearity. High concentrations of PFOS, PFDS, PFDoDA, PFTrDA and PFTeDA (grouped as PC1) were associated with a reduced hatching success of nests where at least one egg hatched, thinner egg shells and increased survival of the hatched chicks. High concentrations of PFDA (PC2) were associated with a reduced hatching success, especially in nests where no eggs hatched, an earlier start of egg laying and a reduction of total breeding success, mainly caused by the failure in hatching.        Although the major manufacturer of PFAAs phased out the production of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related products in 2002, concentrations appear to have increased since previous measurements. Surprisingly, despite the very high concentrations close to the fluorochemical plant, there was no clear evidence for reproductive impairment as the observed associations between PFAA concentrations and reproductive parameters were rather limited compared to previous studies in songbirds. These findings also suggest potential differences in sensitivity between species.

Eggs of great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), herring gull (Larus argentatus) and the domestic White Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) were exposed in ovo by injection into the air sac. Effects on embryo survival were observed following exposure to PFOS and PFOA in chicken and herring gull. Chicken was found to be the most sensitive species with 50 % reduced embryo survival at 8.5 mu g/g egg for PFOS and 2.5 mu g/g egg for PFOA. Cormorant was shown to be the least sensitive species. The difference in sensitivity between chicken and herring gull was a factor of 2.7 for PFOS and 3.5 for PFOA. Between chicken and great cormorant, the sensitivity difference was 2.6 for PFOS and 8.2 for PFOA. Effects on embryo survival were seen at egg injection doses of PFOS close to levels found in environmental samples from wild birds, indicating that PFOS could be having effects in highly exposed populations of birds.

Principal Component Analysis revealed the co-occurrence of the 6 detected PFAS, and differentiated samples from Ebro Delta and Medes Islands, both located in the North-Eastern Mediterranean Sea, with high contribution of all PFAS, from Chafarinas and Atlantic Islands with lower concentration levels and variability. Also, different patterns were observed among colonies, suggesting the fish-based diet plays an important role in PFAS bio-accumulation. In all colonies, except for the Medes Islands, Sigma PFAS decreased through the 10-year study period, with PFOS, PFUnA, and PFTriDA showing a significant concentration reduction in a colony-specific manner.

It is well established that female birds exposed to POPs transfer these compounds to their eggs. However, little is documented with regard to contaminant-related changes in egg quality, such as egg mass, albumen mass, yolk mass, lipid, and water content. We report positive correlations between the concentrations of several major classes of POPs (organochlorines, brominated flame-retardants, and metabolically derived products) in plasma of Arctic-breeding Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus) and in the yolk of the last-laid egg of their clutches. The contributions of the different POP classes to the summed POP concentration were also positively correlated between female plasma and egg yolk. In addition, Glaucous Gulls with a relatively high concentration of sum (Sigma) chlordanes and total-(alpha)-hexabromocyclododecane in their plasma laid smaller eggs. Eggs into which females had deposited a relatively low concentration of Sigma PCB and a relatively high concentration of Sigma DDT were also smaller. The POP patterns of yolk and maternal plasma were associated with changes in water and lipid content of the yolk. These results suggest that egg quality-and, thus, offspring performance-may be affected not only by the direct transfer of contaminants from the female to the egg, but also through associated changes in egg size and composition.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential toxicity of environmental levels of PFOS to yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos under field experimental conditions. In a within-clutch experimental design, we injected two PFOS concentrations (100 ng PFOS/g egg weight and 200 ng PFOS/g egg weight) in ovo soon after laying. Eggs were collected when they reached the cracking stage. We investigated the effects of PFOS treatment, laying order and sex on both morphological and biochemical endpoints of embryos. Specifically, we assessed changes in embryo body mass and tarsus length, as well as in liver and brain mass. Moreover, the imbalance of oxidative status was evaluated in both liver and brain from embryos by measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS), while the levels of protein carbonyl content (PCO) and DNA fragmentation were measured as oxidative and genetic damage endpoints, respectively. The concentrations of PFOS we tested did not significantly alter the morphological endpoints, independently of laying order and sex. Similarly, embryo oxidative status and oxidative and genetic damage were not significantly affected by PFOS in ovo exposure. These findings suggest that current environmental PFOS levels do not affect early development of yellow-legged gull embryos.",NA,NA,NA

To derive toxicity reference values (TRVs) and conduct ecotoxicological risk assessments (ERAs) of PFAS-contaminated ecosystems for wildlife, species-specific PFAS chronic toxicity values (CTVs) are needed. The present study quantified PFAS residues from liver and eggs of birds chronically exposed to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) or a mixture of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and PFHxA that produced a no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) and/or a lowest-observable-adverse-effectlevel (LOAEL). The CTVs we present are lower than those previously reported for birds and should be considered in future regulatory evaluations.

The average concentration in yolk was 1,506 ng/g ww in cormorant and 589 ng/g ww in herring gull. The average liver concentrations of PFOS were 583 ng/g ww in cormorant and 508 ng/g ww in herring gull. At these concentrations, biochemical effects in the developing embryo or effects on embryo survival cannot be ruled out. For perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs), the liver/egg and liver/yolk concentration ratios increased with PFCA chain length in cormorant but not in herring gull, indicating that chain length could possibly affect egg-to-liver transfer of PFCAs and that species differences may exist. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cited By :27

The highest concentrations of PFOS were found in samples from Sweden (mean 400 ng g(-1) wet weight (w.w.)), which were almost five times higher than concentrations found in Norwegian samples (mean 85 ng g(-1) w.w. from both sample sites). The concentrations found in Icelandic and Faroe samples were lowest (mean 16 and 15 ng g(-1) w.w., respectively). Only Swedish samples differed signiflcantly from the other locations. In general, PFCAs show a different spatial trend than PFOS. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was not detected in any sample and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was only detected in samples from Sweden. The most abundant PFCA was perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) with highest concentrations in samples from Sweden (mean 82 ng g(-1) w.w.), samples from the Faroe Islands had the second highest concentration (mean 57 ng g(-1) w.w.) and samples from Iceland and Norway had concentrations ranging between 18 and 30 ng g(-1) w.w. The original hypothesis was based on the idea that PFC concentrations are the highest close to more densely populated and industrialized areas and lower levels in remote areas. However, the geographic pattern is more complicated than predicted and varies among different PFCs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Although bird eggs have often been used to determine and monitor PFAAs levels in the marine environment, this has rarely been done in the terrestrial environment. In the present study we examined the concentrations and composition profile of 12 PFAAs (4 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and 8 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in the eggs of great tits (Parus major) collected at a fluorochemical plant and in three other areas, representing a gradient in distance from the pollution source (from 1 to 70 km), in Antwerp, Belgium.        The PFSA concentrations measured at the site of the fluorochemical plant were among the highest ever reported in eggs with median concentrations of 10380 ng/g (extrapolated), 99.3 ng/g and 47.7 ng/g for PFOS, PFHxS and PFDS respectively. Furthermore, the median concentration of 19.8 ng/g for PFOA was also among the highest ever reported in bird eggs. Although these concentrations decreased sharply with distance from the fluorochemical plant, levels found in the adjacent sites were still high compared to what has been reported in literature. Moreover, based on what is known in literature, it is likely that these concentrations may cause toxicological effects. PFOS was the dominant contributor to the PFSA and PFAAs (63.4-97.6%) profile at each site, whereas for PFCAs this was PFOA at the plant site and the nearest locations (41.0-52.8%) but PFDoA (37.7%) at the farthest location.        Although there is some evidence that PFAAs concentrations close to the plant site are decreasing in comparison with earlier measurements, which may be due to the phase out of PFOS, more research is necessary to understand the extent of the toxicological effects in the vicinity of this PFAAs hotspot.

The contaminant values obtained were compared with published values from the Arctic marine ecosystem. Tetra- and penta-brominated PBDEs were detected at low levels in herring, sprat and common eider (Sigma PBDE 0.3-2.0 ng g(-1) ww), while the levels were higher in the herring gull samples (Sigma PBDE 1.3-29.9 ng g(-1) ww). Hexa-decaBDEs were also found in samples from herring gulls. Eggs from herring gulls from the sub-Arctic contained four times more PBDE than the Swedish herring gulls eggs. Fish samples from the Arctic had two times higher levels of PBDEs and DDTs than similar samples from Sweden. The higher levels of contaminants in fish and seabirds from the Arctic reflect differences in transport processes, feeding ecology (reflected by trophic levels) and metabolism. PBDEs contributed to <10% of the total contaminant load in all investigated samples. The relative contribution of DDTs was higher in fish and bird samples from the Arctic when compared to Swedish samples, e.g. 65% in glaucous gull livers compared to 10% in herring gull livers.

Evidence of direct exposure from PFCA precursor compounds to birds in both freshwater and terrestrial environment was observed. Low levels of diPAPs were detected in a few samples of osprey (<0.02-2.4 ng/g) and common kestrel (<0.02-0.16 ng/g) eggs, and 6:2 RSA was detected in a majority of the osprey eggs (<6.3-52 ng/g). One saturated telomer acid (7:3 FTCA), which is a transformation marker from precursor exposure, was detected in all species (<0.24-2.7 ng/g). The N-15 data showed higher levels in osprey eggs compared to tawny owl and common kestrel, indicating that they feed on a 2-3 times higher trophic level.

Therefore, we compared potential differences in egg PFAA profile and concentrations between two widely studied passerine species, great tit (Parus major) and blue tit ((Cyanistes caenileus), which arc similar in many aspects of their ecology and life history. Whole clutches of both species were collected from the same breeding season and at the same place (Antwerp, Belgium), enabling us to study laying order effects. Additionally, we evaluated how egg PFAA concentrations for both species changed along a distance gradient from a PFAA point source. Although the sum PFAA concentrations did not significantly differ between great tits and blue tits, large differences in PFAA profile and laying order effects were observed. Great tits showed a more diverse PFAA detection profile, including periluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and various long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) but no short-chain compounds. Contrarily, short-chain PFCAs (periluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA)) were only detected in blue tit eggs. The variation of perfluoroocianuic acicl (PFOA) concentrations within clutches was large in both species, although laying order effects on PFOA concentrations were only found in blue tits. Although egg PFOA concentrations of both species decreased similarly from the fluorochemical point source onwards, more variation in egg PFOA concentrations could be explained by distance from the fluorochemical plant in great tits (60%) than in blue tits (15%). Results showed that both species markedly differed in terms of egg PFAA profile and concentrations, must likely reflecting differences in diet, foraging habits and egg protein composition. Finally, biumonituring results of PFAAs in eggs arc likely not generalizable across bird species. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Bird eggs have often been used as less-invasive biomonitoring tools for toxicological risk assessments of persistent organic pollutants, including some PFAAs. Hereby, it is typically assumed that one random egg is representative for the PFAA concentrations of the whole clutch. However, variation of PFAA concentrations within clutches due to laying sequence influences can have important implications for the egg collection strategy and may impede interpretations of the quantified concentrations. Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to study variation patterns and possible laying sequence associations with PFAA concentrations in eggs of the great tit (Parus major). Eight whole clutches (4-8 eggs) were collected at a location in the Antwerp region, situated about 11 km from a known PFAA point source. The Sigma PFAA concentrations ranged from 8.9 to 75.1 ng g(-1) ww. PFOS concentrations ranged from 6.7 to 55.1 ng g(-1) ww and this compound was the dominant contributor to the total PFAA profile (74%), followed by PFDoA (7%), PFOA (7%), PFDA (5%), PFTrA (4%) and PFNA (3%). The within-clutch variation (70.7%) of the Sigma PFAA concentrations was much larger than the among-clutch variation (29.3%) and concentrations decreased significantly for some PFAA compounds throughout the laying sequence. Nevertheless, PFAA concentrations were positively and significantly correlated between some egg pairs within the same clutch, especially between egg 1 and egg 3.

Because of the regulations on perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), its use is expected to increase. Until now, F-53B toxicity data have been scarce and are, to our knowledge, lacking for birds. This study therefore investigated the effects of PFOS and F-53B, separately and as mixtures, on the development of the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). Compounds were injected in ovo, before incubation, at 150 and 1500 ng/g egg. At embryonic day 20, a significantly lower heart rate was observed in all treated groups compared to the control group and hatchlings exposed to the high dose of F-53B had a significantly enlarged liver (8%). Embryonic survival was not affected and no significant effects on hatchling body mass or oxidative stress parameters were found. Our results suggest that these compounds likely have different toxicity thresholds for the investigated endpoints, and/or different modes of action. This study thereby underlines the potential developmental toxicity of PFOS and F-53B at environmentally relevant concentrations. Assessment of PFOS alternatives should therefore continue, preferably prior to their large scale use, as they should be ensured to be less harmful than PFOS itself.",NA,NA,NA

Plasma, preen oil and feather samples were collected from 61 goshawk nestlings in Norway (Trondelag and Troms) in 2015 and 2016, and pollutant concentrations were compared between the three matrices. In plasma, PFASs were detected in the highest concentrations, ranging between 1.37 and 36.0 ng/mL, which suggests that the nestlings were recently and continuously exposed to these emerging contaminants, likely through dietary input. In preen oil, OCPs (169-3560 ng/g) showed the highest concentrations among the investigated compounds, consistent with their high lipophilicity. PFRs (2.60-314 ng/g) were the dominant compounds in feathers and are thought to originate mainly from external deposition, as they were not detected in the other two matrices. NBFRs and DPs were generally not detected in the nestlings, suggesting low presence of these emerging contaminants in their environment and/or low absorption.

Dietary CLA increased the ratio of saturated fatty acid (SFA) and decreased unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) in the egg yolk and CLA sources for fat improved the color stability possibly by inhibition of lipid oxidation and oxymyoglobin oxidation in beef patties. Also dietary CLA reduced purge loss in pork loin, it could be due not only to high intramuscular fat content but also to stability of cell membrane lipids assumed by the observed delay in lipid oxidation for CLA. Cholesterol content in egg yolk was significantly decreased by a supply of dietary CLA for 5 weeks feeding. Dietary CLA and storage of CLA eggs increased the firmness of hard-cooked egg yolk and the texture of yolks from hard-cooked CLA eggs was rubbery and elastic and yolk were more difficult to break using an Instron. The eggs produced by hens fed CLA were hard and were characterized by a reddish yolk when cooled to 4 degrees C for 10 weeks. Several studies have determined the antioxidant property of CLA. The oxidative reactions could influence CLA concentrations by either causing the formation of linoleic acid radicals, which in turn could be converted to CLA by hydrogen donors, or causing the oxidative destruction of the conjugated double-bond system of CLA.

The exposure to PFAAs in peregrine falcons is likely mediated by dietary factors such as foraging location (delta C-13 and (delta S-34) and trophic position (delta N-15) given the associations observed in eggs and nestling plasma, respectively. Moreover, significant relationships were observed for circulating Sigma PFCAs and region (rural/urban), and nestling body condition after adjusting for sampling year and dietary tracers, suggesting that compared to rural nestlings, urban nestlings may be more exposed to Sigma PFCAs and prone to their potential physiological impacts. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating dietary, biological and ecological factors when studying PFAS exposure in birds.",NA,NA,NA

The concentration of 10 PFAAs in environmental and biological samples (water, soil, grass, chicken egg yolk, serum of horses, cattle and sheep), as well as human serum was investigated to determine the extent of contamination in the town and discuss fate and redistribution of PFAAs. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFAA in all matrices investigated, followed by perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS). PFOS concentrations measured in water ranged between <0.17-14 mu g/L, concentrations of PFHxS measured between <0.07-6 mu g/L. PFAAs were detected in backyards (soil, grass), livestock and chicken egg yolk. Significant differences (p < 0.01) in PFOS and PFHxS concentrations in two groups of cattle were found, one held within the contamination plume, the other in the vicinity but outside of the contamination plume. In human serum PFOS concentrations ranged from 38 to 381 mu g/L, while PFHxS ranged from 39 to 214 mu g/L. Highest PFOS concentrations measured in human serum were >30-fold higher compared to the general Australian population. Through use of contaminated groundwater secondary sources of PFAA contamination are created on private property, leading to further redistribution of contamination and creation of additional human exposure pathways.

However, PFAAs dynamics in the environment and the factors that determine wildlife exposure are still not well understood. In this study we examined PFAAs exposure in chicks of a generalist seabird species, the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), breeding 49 km away of a PFAAs hotspot (a fluorochemical plant in Antwerp, Belgium). In order to study the pathways of PFAAs exposure, we measured how chicks' PFAAs burden varied with age, sex, and body condition. In addition, we related PFAA concentrations to chicks' diet using stable isotope signatures. For this purpose, we studied plasma PFAA concentrations in 1-week and 4-week-old gull chicks. Only 4 (PFOS, PFOA, PFDA and PFNA) out of the 13 target PFAA compounds were detected. Measured concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were generally high compared to other seabird species but were highly variable between individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that maternal transfer plays a significant role in determining chicks' PFAAs burden, and that there are variable sources of exposure for PFOS and PFOA during post-hatching development. The association between PFOS and specific stable isotopes (i.e. delta N-15 and delta C-13) suggests a higher exposure to PFOS in birds with a predominantly marine diet. We also found that males' condition was positively associated with PFOS plasmatic concentration, probably due to the indirect effect of being fed a high quality (marine) diet which appears PFOS rich. Yet, exact exposure source(s) for PFOA remain(s) unclear. Given that PFOS concentrations measured in some chicks surpassed the toxicity reference value calculated for top avian predators, continued monitoring of exposure and health of this gull population, and other wildlife populations inhabiting the area, is highly recommended.

Egg-laying sequence and selected maternal tissues may impact on assessment of potential maternal transfer of contaminants. Here, this hypothesis was verified by exposing chickens (Gallus domesticus) to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and dechlorane plus (DPs). Concentrations in eggs laid during exposure exhibited periodic fluctuations (conforming to egg-laying cycles) and a decreasing trend during depuration. Fluctuation patterns of DPs and BDE209 differed from those of other compounds. The PBDE congener profiles in eggs were dominated by BDE209 during exposure and by BDE100 and 153 during depuration. The abundance of PCB congener (CB138) which is recalcitrant to metabolism increased with laying sequence. Maternal transfer potential was negatively correlated (P = 0.0014, R-2 = 0.7874) to the log K-OW of chemicals (log K-OW >7) when the muscle, heart, lung, or stomach was used. No correlations were found when the liver, fat, kidneys, or intestine was used (log K-OW >7), although DPs and BDE209 showed the highest maternal transfer potential. Different fluctuation patterns of DPs and BDE209 in eggs and increased abundance of BDE209 in eggs laid in the initial egg-laying period imply that the liver, fat, kidney, or intestinal tissues could be more appropriate in assessing maternal transfer of the target analytes.

To track continuing exposures to PFASs and assess the impact of the 2002 phase-out of production of PFOS and related chemicals in the US, nine perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs; C4-C12), three perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs; C4, C6, C8) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA, a PFOS precursor) were measured in SF Bay cormorant eggs in 2012 and harbor seal serum sampled between 2009 and 2014. PFOS remained the dominant perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) in both cormorant eggs (36.1-466 ng/g) and seals (12.6-796 ng/g) from 2012 and 2014, respectively. Concentrations in seal and bird eggs from the South Bay have declined approximately 70% in both matrices. To elucidate potential pathways of exposure, prey fish, sediments and wastewater effluent were analyzed for PFASs, and in the case of sediment and effluent, a suite of PFAA precursors. PFOS was the dominant PFAA in prey fish and sediment. In effluent,, different mixtures of PFAAs were measured, with PFOS, PFHxA, and PFOA detected in the highest concentrations. Polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diesters (PFCA-precursors) were observed at concentrations over an order of magnitude higher than PFCAs in sediment, highlighting their importance as a potential, on-going source of PFCAs to SF Bay wildlife. These findings suggest that the PFOS phase-out has resulted in reduced burdens to wildlife in SF Bay, but that exposure to diverse and incompletely characterized PFASs continues.

This complicates logistical dose-response modeling and establishment of a threshold value characterizing the chronic toxicity of PFAS to ecological receptors. We examined reproduction, growth, and survival endpoints using a combination of hypothesis testing and logistical dose-response modeling of northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) exposed to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) alone and to PFHxA in a binary mixture with perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) via the drinking water. The exposure concentration chronic toxicity value (CTV) representative of the lowest-observable-adverse effect level (LOAEL) threshold for chronic oral PFAS toxicity (based on reduced offspring weight and growth rate) was 0.10 ng/mL for PFHxA and 0.06 ng/mL for a PFOS:PFHxA (2.7:1) mixture. These estimates corresponded to an adult LOAEL average daily intake CTV of 0.0149 and 0.0082 mu g x kg body weight(-1) x d(-1), respectively. Neither no-observable-adverse effect level threshold and representative CTVs nor dose-response and predicted effective concentration values could be established for these 2 response variables. The findings indicate that a reaction(s) occurs among the individual PFAS components present in the mixture to alter the potential toxicity, demonstrating that mixture affects avian PFAS toxicity. Thus, chronic oral PFAS toxicity to avian receptors represented as the sum of the individual compound toxicities may not necessarily be the best method for assessing chronic mixture exposure risk at PFAS-contaminated sites.

Analytical method for eggs was only validated for PFOS and PFOA because of interfering substance appeared in some samples. The method applied on foods of animal origin includes alkaline digestion, extraction, and clean- up with solid phase extraction and adsorption on granular carbonwhere necessary. The method was shown effective to eliminate taurodeoxycholic acid (TDC), a bile acid that is an endogenous interference compound in egg samples causing ionization suppression and false positive result for PFOS when 499 > 80 transition was used for quantification. The validation was performed and resulted in recoveries >70% for all three PFAAs, the limits of quantification (LOQs) in all matrices were 3.1 pg g(-1), 3.4 pg g(-1), and 4.9 pg g(-1) for PFHxS, PFOA, and L-PFOS, respectively. The optimized method was successfully applied to 53 food samples from the Swedish market and from developing countries. PFOS and PFOA were detected in all samples. PFHxS was detected in 76% of the samples. Further method development on separating interfering substance from PFHxS in egg is warranted due to relatively high detection of this compound in other food items. With this method, concentrations in the low pg g(-1) range in food samples of animal origin were quantified including the branched PFOS isomers. This method can be applied to enforce potential future limit values for PFOS and PFOA as a consequence of the recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommendation where the tolerable intakes have been drastically lowered. Further method development is needed for foods of plant origin such as vegetables, flour, nuts, or bread. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as C-male/C-female (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process.

In the current study, potential developmental cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity following HFPO-DA exposure in chicken embryo has been investigated, focusing on the roles of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), the major molecular target in PFOA-induced toxicities. HFPO-DA was exposed to fertile chicken eggs via air cell injection, morphology and function of the target organs (heart and liver) in hatchlings were investigated with histopathology and electrocardiography, and the serum levels of HFPO-DA had been measured with quadrupoletime of flight liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Q-TOF LC/MS). Additionally, lentivirus-mediated in ovo PPAR alpha silencing was used to assess the roles of PPAR alpha in HFPO-DA induced developmental toxicities. The results indicated that developmental exposure to HFPO-DA induced developmental cardiotoxicity, including thinned right ventricular wall and elevated heart rates, similar to those observed with PFOA exposure, as well as developmental hepatotoxicity in the form of steatosis. Silencing of PPAR alpha alleviated such effects, suggesting participation of PPAR alpha in HFPO-DA induced developmental toxicities in chicken embryo. Moreover, enhanced expression of PPAR alpha downstream genes, cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (EHHADH), were observed in HFPO-DA exposed animal heart tissues, which can be abolished by PPAR alpha silencing. On the other hand, liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and CD36 expression were effectively enhanced in exposed liver tissues, but not EHHADH, suggesting differential mechanism of toxicity in heart and liver tissues. In summary, developmental exposure to HFPO-DA induced developmental cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in hatchling chickens similar to PFOA, and PPAR alpha still participates in such toxicities, with some differential downstream gene regulations in different organs.

Eggs are the origin of new life of ovipara and are rich in nutrients, thus they serve as one of the main protein sources for humans. Therefore, the level of pollutants in eggs can affect the reproduction of ovipara, and it is also related to human health by food intake. In recent years, poultry egg samples have been widely used in the assessment of biological and ecological pollution as a non-invasive biota matrix. At the same time, recent studies have used eggs to evaluate the developmental toxicity and associated health risks based on the pollutant levels in egg samples. In this study, the methods of sample pretreatment and instrumental detection of PFASs for egg samples are summarized. In addition, the application of eggs as a pollutants bioindicator of PFASs contamination has been discussed.",NA,NA,NA

Laboratory studies have indicated that PFOS is embryotoxic to domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), but the mechanisms of toxicity in the developing avian embryo remain unknown. We recently demonstrated that PFOS acts as a peroxisome proliferator by causing increased expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha)-regulated genes in cultured primary chicken embryo hepatocytes. The present study examined whether PPAR alpha-regulated genes were close-dependently affected in chicken embryos exposed in ovo to PFOS. White leghorn chicken eggs were injected with 0.1, 5.0 or 100.0 mu g PFOS/g egg into the air cell prior to incubation. Embryos were incubated until pipping, after which the expression of PPARa-regulated genes was measured in the liver tissue of surviving embryos using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A dose-dependent decrease in embryo pippability was observed with an LD50 of 93 mu g/g (3.54 mu g/g-672,910 mu g/g, 95% confidence interval). Hepatic PFOS concentrations increased concomitantly with dose. The PPARa-regulated genes measured were peroxisomal acyl CoA oxidase, bifunctional enzyme, liver fatty acid binding protein and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl thiolase. PFOS exposure via egg injection prior to incubation did not affect the transcriptional activity of any of the assayed PPAR alpha-regulated genes at any of the doses examined in day 21 chicken embryos.

Plasma from black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and northern fulmar (Fulmarus gladalis) chicks were sampled in Kongsfjorden. Svalbard in 2006. The samples were analyzed for thyroid hormones and a wide range of HOCs (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydroxylated (OH-) and methylsulphoned (MeSO-) PCB metabolites, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs)).        Concentrations of HOCs were generally low in kittiwake and fulmar chicks compared to previous reports. HOC concentrations were five times higher in fulmar chicks compared to in kittiwake chicks. PFCs dominated the summed HOCs concentrations in both species (77% in kittiwakes and 69% in fulmars).        Positive associations between total thyroxin (TT4) and PFCs (PFHpS, PFOS, PFNA) were found in both species. Although correlations do not implicate causal relationships per se, the correlations are of concern as disruption of TH homeostasis may cause developmental effects in young birds.

As expected, OHP concentrations were higher in chicken eggs collected from the location (site 1) approaching the e-waste recycling center than from the location (site 2) far from the e-waste recycling center. Also, much higher OHP levels were observed in goose eggs foraging in residential area (site 2) than that in agricultural area (site 1), suggesting a clear habitat dependent OHP bioaccumulation pattern both concerning distance from e-waste activities and type of foraging habitat. Goose eggs exhibited higher short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) concentrations but lower PBDE and OHFR levels than chicken eggs. The proportion of high brominated PBDEs (hepta-to deca-BDEs) was lower in goose eggs than that in chicken eggs and showed a clear decrease from site 1 to site 2. DP isomeric composition f(anti) values (the ratio of the anti-DP to the sum of the anti- and syn-DP) in goose eggs were significantly lower than those in chicken eggs (p < 0.001). These differences are likely a reflection of factors such as the species-specific differences in habitat preference and the differing environmental behaviors of the pollutants owing to their inherent properties (such as solubility and vapor pressure). Our findings suggested a high dietary intake of OHPs via home-produced eggs. For BDE99 there is a potential health concern with respect to the current dietary exposure via eggs.

Target analysis determined Sigma PFAS concentrations in bream livers of 8.7-282 mu g kg(-1) wet weight (ww) in 2019, with highest contaminations in the Rhine and lower Elbe. In bream fillet, concentrations were lower (<0.5-10.6 mu g kg(-1) Sigma PFAS). Contamination of suspended particulate matter (SPM) was highest in the upper Elbe downstream the Czech border (5.5 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (dw) in 2018). Herring gull eggs from the North and Baltic Seas showed Sigma PFAS levels around 53.0-69.6 mu g kg(-1) ww in 2019.

The dTOP assay revealed that considerable amounts of precursors were present at most riverine sampling sites. Particularly high precursor concentrations were observed in samples from the Upper Elbe at the Czech border and the Upper and Middle Rhine. In herring gull eggs and most soil samples, though, concentrations of precursors were low. Time trend analysis showed decreasing trends for most detected PFAS since 2005. In SPM, however, C4-C6 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids seem to increase indicating growing use of precursors based on shorter fluorinated chains.        The results demonstrate that target analysis detects only a minor fraction of the PFAS burdens in environmental samples. The dTOP assay can support risk assessment and chemical monitoring with more comprehensive exposure data of the actual contamination. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.",NA,NA,NA

They have become a global concern because of the toxicity and bioaccumulative properties. With the increasing availability of high-resolution mass spectrometers, many novel PFASs have been identified. Studies published between 2009 and 2017 have discovered 455 new PFASs (including nine fully and 446 partially fluorinated compounds), 45%, 29%, 17%, and 8% of which are anions, zwitterions, cations, and neutrals, respectively.

This article integrates and critically evaluates what is known about these newly identified PFASs. It discusses the different aspects of detection methodologies. It also surveys the removal of these compounds during conventional and advanced drinking-water and wastewater treatment, predicts the relevant physicochemical properties by means of four software programs, and identifies major knowledge gaps. Notably, a number of these newly identified PFASs are potential precursor compounds of PFOS and PFOA. Studies are critically needed to understand the removal and transformation of these compounds in natural and engineered environmental systems and their contribution, if any, to the secondary formation of PFOS and PFOA in these systems.

To test this, we compared PFAS in south polar skuas and their main prey from two breeding sites on opposite sides of the Antarctic continent: Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) stomach content, eggs, chicks, and adults from Svarthamaren in Dronning Maud Land and Adelie penguin chicks (Pygoscelis adeliae) from Dumont d'Urville in Adelie Land. Of the 22 PFAS analysed, seven were present in the majority of samples, except petrel stomach content [only perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA) present] and Adelie penguins (only four compounds present), with increasing concentrations from the prey to the skuas. The biomagnification factors (BMFs) were higher at Dumont d'Urville than Svarthamaren. When adjusted to reflect one trophic level difference, the BMFs at Svarthamaren remained the same, whereas the ones at Dumont d'Urville doubled. At both the colonies, the skua PFAS pattern was dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), followed by PFUnA, but differed with the presence of branched PFOS and perfluorotetradecanoate (PFTeA) and lack of perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) at Dumont d'Urville. At Svarthamaren, the pattern in the prey was comparable to the skuas, but with a higher relative contribution of PFTeA in prey. At Dumont d'Urville, the pattern in the prey differed from the skuas, with the domination of PFUnA and the general lack of PFOS in prey. Even though the PFAS levels are low in Antarctic year-round resident prey, the three lines of evidence (pattern, BMF difference, and BMF adjusted to one trophic level) suggest that the Antarctic petrel are the significant source of PFAS in the Svarthamaren skuas, whereas the skuas in Dumont d'Urville have other important sources to PFAS than Adelie penguin, either in the continent or external on the inter-breeding foraging grounds far from Antarctica.",NA,NA,NA

The thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) is a key species for monitoring contaminants in the Canadian Arctic and lays only a single egg per year. Therefore, the potential issue of intra-clutch variation in contaminant concentrations is avoided. However, if the egg is removed or lost early in the incubation stage, the adult female murre will relay. In this study, we examined contaminant concentrations and patterns in first-laid and replacement eggs of thick-billed murres breeding in northern Hudson Bay in order to determine whether or not these eggs could be sampled interchangeably. Concentrations of the major legacy organochlorines (e.g. PCBs, DDT, chlordanes) were generally higher, and total mercury concentrations lower, in the replacement eggs compared with the first-laid eggs. The organochlorine profile was comprised primarily of Sigma DDT and Sigma 70PCB, and Sigma 70PCB was comprised primarily of hexa-hepta PCBs in both first-laid and replacement eggs. As both concentrations and organochlorine patterns showed differences between first-laid and replacement eggs, we recommend that randomly selected first-laid eggs of thick-billed murres be consistently sampled for contaminant monitoring in the Canadian Arctic.

Their widespread detection and accumulation in the environment raise concerns about whether these chemicals might be developmental toxicants and teratogens in ecosystem. We evaluated and compared the toxicity of PFCs of containing various numbers of carbon atoms (C8-11 carbons) on vertebrate embryogenesis. We assessed the developmental toxicity and teratogenicity of various PFCs. The toxic effects on Xenopus embryos were evaluated using different methods. We measured teratogenic indices (TIs), and investigated the mechanisms underlying developmental toxicity and teratogenicity by measuring the expression of organ-specific biomarkers such as xPTB (liver), Nkx2.5 (heart), and Cyl18 (intestine). All PFCs that we tested were found to be developmental toxicants and teratogens. Their toxic effects were strengthened with increasing length of the fluorinated carbon chain. Furthermore, we produced evidence showing that perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFuDA) are more potent developmental toxicants and teratogens in an animal model compared to the other PFCs we evaluated [perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)]. In particular, severe defects resulting from PFDA and PFuDA exposure were observed in the liver and heart, respectively, using whole mount in situ hybridization, real-time PCR, pathologic analysis of the heart, and dissection of the liver.

PCB concentrations in eggs increased with later hatch date, independent of lipid content which also increased over time. Some females may remobilize and transfer more PCBs to their eggs, by delaying migration several weeks, relying on more polluted and stored resources, or being in poor body condition when arriving at the breeding grounds.

Brood patch provides efficient heat transfer between the incubating parent and the developing embryo in the egg. Importantly, several environmental contaminants are already known to have adverse effects on avian reproduction. However, relatively little is known about the effect of contaminants on incubation temperature (T-inc) in wild birds. By using temperature thermistors placed into artificial eggs, we investigated whether the most contaminated parent birds are less able to provide appropriate egg warming and thus less committed to incubating their clutch. Specifically, we investigated the relationships among 3 groups of contaminants (organochlorines, perfluoroalkyl substances [PFASs], and mercury [Hg]) with T-inc and also with prolactin concentrations and brood patch size in incubating Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Our results reveal that among the organochlorines considered, only blood levels of oxychlordane, the main metabolite of chlordane, a banned pesticide, were negatively related to the minimum incubation temperature in male kittiwakes. Levels of PFASs and Hg were unrelated to T-inc in kittiwakes. Moreover, our study suggests a possible underlying mechanism: since we reported a significant and negative association between blood oxychlordane concentrations and the size of the brood patch in males. Finally, this reduced T-inc in the most oxychlordane-contaminated kittiwakes was associated with a lower egg hatching probability. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2881-2894. (c) 2018 SETAC",NA,NA,NA

Three arms of the immune system were tested; T cell, B cell, and innate immunity. After 6 weeks exposure, quail were challenged with E. coli infection to test the ultimate measure of immunotoxicity, disease resistance. The T cell response was lower in the high exposure groups. Antibody mediated, and innate immune responses were not different. Growth rate was higher, whereas thyroid hormone levels were lower in PFOA-exposed birds. Morbidity/mortality from disease challenge was not different among the control and PFOA-exposed groups, and no overt PFOA toxicity was observed pre-disease challenge.        Although PFOA at 'worst case scenario' levels caused T cell immunosuppression, this did not translate into increased disease susceptibility, demonstrating that immunotoxicity testing must be interpreted with caution since disease resistance is the ultimate concern.

However, because assessment of effects by use of dietary exposure of adults is time-consuming and expensive, a study was conducted to compare effects on embryos via nanoinjection and waterborne exposure. Nanoinjection, in which small amounts of chemicals are injected into developing eggs, was used to incorporate PFOS into the yolk sac of embryos of zebrafish. Effects of PFOS during the period of development of the embryo were assessed within 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). PFOS significantly retarded development of embryos of zebrafish and resulted in abnormalities as well as lethality of developing embryos. Both methods of exposure, waterborne and nanoinjection, resulted in similar dose-dependent effects. Some sublethal effects, such as edema at 48 hpf, delayed hatching, and curvature of the spine was observed after 72 hpf. In ovo, nanoinjection was deemed to be an accurate method of exposure for controlling the actual internal dose for study of adverse effects, which closely mimicked responses to waterborne exposure of zebrafish embryo to PFOS.",NA,NA,NA

The highest mean concentration was obtained for perfluorooctane sulfortate (PFOS, 7.64 ng/ml), followed by perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS, 3.56 ng/ml) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 1.80 ng/ml). Four other FOCs showed mean levels between 0.30 and 0.44 ng/ml, whereas those of the remaining 6 compounds were below the detection limit. Regarding gender, the blood levels of PFHxS and PFOA were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in men than in women, while differences according to age were only noted for PFHxS (p < 0.05) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) (p < 0.001), for which the levels were higher in the younger (25 +/- 5 years) group of subjects. A significant correlation between PFOS levels and those of the remaining detected FOCs (except PFDA) was found.

Plasma EFs were similar in magnitude and direction to El's previously reported in glaucous gulls from other arctic food webs, suggesting overall similarities in the biochemical processes influencing the EFs of bioaccumulated organochlorine (OC) contaminants within the food webs at those locations. Additionally, EFs in yolk of eggs collected concurrently from within the same nesting colonies varied with location, laying date, and OC concentrations, and may be influenced by changes in the local feeding ecology between those colonies. No differences were found between the El's for any analyte in female gulls compared to those found in egg yolk, indicating that processes involved in the maternal transfer of chlordanes and PCBs to eggs do not modulate the stereochemical ratio between enantiomers, Therefore, the use of eggs as a valuable and noninvasive means of OC biomonitoring may also extend to enantiomer compositions in glaucous gulls, and perhaps also in other seabird species from arctic regions.",NA,NA,NA

Methods: A total of 892 E. coli isolates collected from individual pigs (n=368), chickens (n=196), ducks (n=261), geese (n=35), pigeons (n=20) and partridges (n=12) in Guangdong Province during 2002-08 were screened for the presence of fosA3, fosA and fosC2 by PCR amplification and sequencing. The clonal relationship of fosA3-positive isolates, plasmid content and other associated resistance genes were also characterized.        Results: Twelve (1.3%) E. coli isolates showed resistance to fosfomycin and 10 (1.1%) isolates (4 from pigs, 2 from chickens, 2 from ducks, 1 from a goose and 1 from a pigeon) were positive for fosA3. None of the E. coli isolates was positive for fosA or fosC2. All of the isolates carrying fosA3 were CTX-M producers, and three of them carried rmtB.

The terrestrial environment was sampled for soil, sediments and biota such as moose, mouse, brown trout and perch at the freshwater lake in Dalsvatn, Telemark, Norway. The marine environment of Lofoten and Troms and Finnmark in Northern Norway was sampled for sediments and biota such as Common eider and Herring gull eggs, Cod liver, mussels and seal liver. Seven species from Svalbard was collected in 2007 to 2009; Blood from Polar bear, Ringed Seal and Glaucous gull, eggs from Common Eider and Black-legged Kittiwake and liver from Cod and whole Polar cod was sampled. Pentabromophenol was generally below the detection limits in terrestrial and marine samples in Norway and Arctic samples, while 2,4,6-tribromophenol was found in almost all samples. The relatively new BFRs, Decabromodiphenyl-ethane was detected in the majority of mainland marine samples in Norway and the Arctic while Bis(2-ethylhexyl)tetrabromophthalate generally was below or close to the detection limits. The short chained (C10-13) and medium chained (C14-17) chlorinated paraffins on the other hand were only analyzed for in Arctic biota and were detected in the majority of samples. In order to distinguish between pollution levels caused by long-range transport and point sources, to establish a base line for time- and spatial trends and have a general knowledge about background levels in the Norwegian environment, samples representing all important ecosystems collected at remote locations were analyzed.        The reported levels are very valuable data on background levels for a variety of compounds. With this knowledge future changes can be assessed as well as the impact of point sources and new exposure routes. We managed to determine background levels for a number of pollutants of concern in the abiotic and biotic parts of the terrestrial and marine ecosystem representing the Norwegian mainland and the Arctic. Since most of the target compounds are potential substitutes for already regulated chemicals, the collected data can give information on whether they already pose a threat to the environment as well and to assess eventual future risks.        From the 17 analysed PFAS only 10 were detected. Lowest PFAS levels were found in abiota samples and highest PFAS levels were found in seal liver, plasma and eggs of marine birds and polar bear plasma. No considerable differences were found for sumPFAS levels collected at the Norwegian mainland and Svalbard with the exception of PFOS which contributes more to mainland samples. Perfluorinated carboxylacids are mostly contributing to terrestrial samples whilst perfluorinated sulfonates are more important in marine biota. Found PFAS levels are in good agreement with background data described in literature. However, since different time trends are observed for different PFAS, comparison of data is challenging. In general do PFCAs have a much more diverse use and emission pattern, making it more difficult to assess their sources and fate. The finding of dominating PFCAs in some cases is very interesting since it has been barely observed before and might be a sign of parallel decreasing PFOS- and increasing PFCA trends also in Norwegian background locations. The PFOS substitutes 6:2 FTS and PFDcS were only detected very occasionally and at levels very close to the quantification limit, mostly field mouse liver and soil. The rare findings indicate either only limited use of these chemicals or that they are not stable enough to reach remote locations. In contrast are FTOHs and FT(U)CAs widely used chemicals which seem to be either to volatile to be taken up by organisms or too chemical reactive to reach remote areas.        Of the 5 analysed BFR PBDE 47 and DBDPE were the most detected BFRs within this study, with DBDPE dominating over the PBDE 47 in a number of cases. This is indicating the continuation of the decreasing trend of PBDE 47 in Norwegian environment due to the ban of this chemical. TBP was detected in a broad range of samples as well opposite to PBP which was only detected very sparsely. Since TBP can be formed naturally in the marine environment as well conclusion of eventual sources are difficult. Both SCCPs and MCCPs were detected in the majority of the Arctic samples with the exception of only 10% detection of MCCPS in cod liver. SCCP > MCCP for polar bear and seal plasma, kittiwake eggs, cod liver and polar cod. The opposite is the case for glaucous gull plasma and eider duck eggs.",NA,NA,NA

Levels of OPEs, CPs and HFRs were generally similar or higher than those of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and/or hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD). OPE, CP and HFR concentrations were also similar to PCBs and DDTs in blue mussel, viviparous eelpout and Atlantic herring. In marine mammals and birds, PCB and DDT concentrations remained orders of magnitude higher than those of OPEs, CPs, HFRs and PFAS. Predator-prey ratios for individual OPEs (0.28-3.9) and CPs (0.40-5.0) were similar or somewhat lower than those seen for BDE-47 (5.0-29) and HBCDD (2.4-13).

Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations.        Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis.        Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend.        Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe.",NA,NA,NA

Concentrations of PFOS precursors and diPAPs exceeded PFOS and PFCA concentrations, respectively, in zooplankton, but not in fish and guillemot eggs. Although PFOS precursors were present at all trophic levels, they appear to play a minor role in food web accumulation of PFOS based on PFOS precursor/PFOS ratios and PFOS and FOSA isomer patterns.

An initial frog embryo teratogenicity assay-Xenopus (FETAX) assay was performed that identified perfluorohexanoic (PFHxA) and perfluoroheptanoic (PFHpA) acids as potential teratogens and developmental toxicants.

Whole-mount in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and histologic analyses detected severe defects in the liver and heart following exposure to PFHxA or PFHpA. In addition, immunoblotting revealed that PFHpA significantly increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while PFHxA slightly increased these, as compared with the control.

White women had higher concentrations of linear perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) compared with the Chinese in Oakland (p < 0.0001) and blacks in Pittsburgh (p = 0.048). Black women in Southeast Michigan and Boston (vs. white women) had higher concentrations of linear (p < 0.001 for Southeast Michigan; p < 0.0001 for Boston) and total perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (p < 0.001 for both Southeast Michigan and Boston) and 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (p = 0.02 for Southeast Michigan; p < 0.001 for Boston). Chinese (Oakland) and Japanese (Los Angeles) women had higher concentrations of perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) compared with white women in each site (p < 0.01 for both). Within white women, those in Pittsburgh had relatively higher concentrations of PFAS. Within Chinese and Japanese women, those who were born outside the US had significantly lower concentrations of most PFAS but significantly higher PFNA concentrations. Menstrual bleeding and parity were significantly associated with lower PFAS concentrations. Higher intake of salty snacks including popcorn was significantly associated with higher concentrations of linear PFOA, PFOS and 2-(N-ethyl-per-fluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid.        Discussion: Geographic locations and race/ethnicity play an important role in differential exposure to PFAS, with racial/ethnic burdens differing between PFOS, PFOA and PFNA. Menstruation and parity were also determinants of PFAS concentrations possibly as an elimination route.",NA,NA,NA

Earlier studies of the geographical distribution of PFCs focused primarily on the Northern Hemisphere, while little attention was paid to the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, livers from eight species of albatrosses, blood from elephant seal, and blood and eggs from penguins and polar skua collected from the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic during 1995 - 2005 were analyzed for 10 PFCs. In addition, for comparison with the Southern Ocean samples, we analyzed liver, sera, and eggs from two species of albatrosses from Midway Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were found in livers of albatrosses from the Southern Ocean. PFOS was the major contaminant, although the concentrations were < 5 ng/g, wet wt, in 92% of the albatross livers analyzed. PFOA was detected in 30% of the albatross livers, with a concentration range of < 0.6 - 2.45 ng/g, wet wt. Other PFCs, including long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs), were below the limits of quantitation in livers of albatrosses from the Southern Ocean. In liver, sera, and eggs of albatrosses from the North Pacific Ocean, long-chain PFCAs (perfluorononanoate, perfluorodecanoate, perfluoroundecanoate, and perfluorododecanoate) were found at concentrations similar to those of PFOS and PFOA. The mean concentration of PFOS in livers of Laysan albatrosses from the North Pacific Ocean (5.1 ng/g, wet wt) was higher than that in several species of albatrosses from the Southern Ocean (2.2 ng/g, wet wt). Species-specific differences in the concentrations of PFOS were noted among Southern Ocean albatrosses, whereas geographical differences in PFOS concentrations among the Indian Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, and South Atlantic Ocean were insignificant. Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were, respectively, 2- and 17-fold higher in liver than in sera of Laysan albatrosses. PFOS was found in the blood of elephant seals from Antarctica at concentrations ranging from < 0.08 to 3.52 ng/mL. PFOS was found in eggs (2.1 - 3.1 ng/g) and blood (< 0.24 - 1.4 ng/mL) of polar skuas but was not detected in penguins from Antarctica. Our study documents the existence of low but detectable levels of PFOS and PFOA in Southern Hemisphere fauna, suggesting distribution of these compounds on a global scale.",NA,NA,NA

Ingestion is a vital pathway for PFASs to transmit to humans especially through water and fish. In present study, PFASs in water and fish from the drinking water source of Beijing in China were investigated. Three layers of water were collected in order to find the connection between concentrations of PFASs and depth of water, which showed no prominent correlation. PFASs in water from Miyun Reservoir with concentrations of 5.30-8.50 ng/L, were relatively lower compared with other reports on raw drinking water. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the dominant PFASs. In addition, six species of fish (including Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, Erythroculter dabryi, Pseudohemiculter dispar, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Siniperca chuatsi) were analyzed, with concentrations of PFASs ranging from 1.70 to 14.32 ng/g wet weight (w.w.). Due to relatively stronger bioaccumulation potential, long chain perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs) were detected with higher concentrations, especially perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PFASs through drinking water and fish consumption were 0.20-0.34 and 3.44-12.61 ng/kg bw/day based on Exposure Factors Handbook of Chinese Population, respectively. In addition, the EDI of high priority concern PFASs via pork, chicken and dust were also calculated, with value of 0.015-0.043, 0.003-0.013 and 0.074-0.390 ng/kg bw/day, respectively. The total EDI of PFOS and PFOA via diverse pathways were less than suggested tolerable daily intake (PFOS, 150 ng/kg bw/day; PFOA, 1500 ng/kg bw/day), indicating that the detected levels would not cause severe health effects on Beijing residents.",NA,NA,NA

We assessed PFAS concentrations in green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles from the North Pacific. Fifteen compounds were quantified via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry from 62 green turtle and 6 hawksbill plasma samples from Hawai'i, Palmyra Atoll, and the Northern Marianas Islands. Plasma from 14 green turtles severely afflicted with fibropapillomatosis, and eggs from 12 Hawaiian hawksbill nests from 7 females were analyzed. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) predominated in green turtle plasma; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) predominated in hawksbill tissues. Concentrations were greater in hawksbill than green turtle plasma (p < 0.05), related to trophic differences. Green turtle plasma PFOS concentrations were related to human populations from highest to lowest: Hawai'i, Marianas, Palmyra. Influence on fibropapillomatosis was not evident. PFASs were maternally transferred to hawksbill eggs, with decreasing concentrations with distance from airports and with clutch order from one female. A risk assessment of PFOS showed concern for immunosuppression in Kailua green turtles and alarming concern for hawksbill developmental toxicity. Perfluoroundecanoic (PFUnA) and perfluorotridecanoic (PFTriA) acid levels were correlated with reduced emergence success (p < 0.05). Studies to further examine PFAS effects on sea turtle development would be beneficial.        (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Effect of various parameters such as metal ion concentration, ionophore concentration, liquid-liquid extraction, back extraction, comparison of transport efficiency of BLM and SLM and different membrane support (hen's egg shell and PTFE) have been studied. In BLM ionophores (R-2-R-5) transport Zn+ at greater extent and the observed trend for the transport of Zn2+ is R-2 > R-4 > R-3 > R-5 respectively. Further transport efficiency is increased in SLM. In egg shell membrane ionophores (R-2-R-5) transport Zn+ due to their non-cyclic structure and pseudo cavity formation while ionophore R-1 transports Cu2+ ions at greater extent due to its cyclic structure and cavity size. Among the membrane support used egg shell membrane is found best for the transport of zinc ions because of its hydrophobic nature and exhibits electrostatic interactions between positively charged zinc ions and -COOH group of egg shell membrane. Thus structure of ionophores, hydrophobicity and porosity of the membrane support plays important role in separation of metal ions.",NA,NA,NA

The pattern of PFSAs was dominated by perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; >89% of Sigma PFSA concentration) regardless of egg collection location. The highest Sigma PFSA concentrations were found in the eggs collected in the urbanized areas in the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River area [Big Chicken Island 308 ng/g ww, Toronto Harbour 486 ng/g ww, and Ile Deslauriers (HG) 299 ng/g ww]. Also, eggs from all freshwater colony sites had higher Sigma PFSA concentrations, which were significant (p < 0.05) in many cases, compared to the marine sites with the exception of the Sable Island colony in Atlantic Canada off the coast of Nova Scotia. C6 to C15 chain length PFCAs were detected in the eggs, although the pattern was variable among the 15 sites, where PFUnA and PFTrA dominated the pattern for most colonies. Like the Sigma PFSA, the highest concentrations of Sigma PFCA were found in the eggs from Big Chicken Island, Toronto Harbour, Ile Deslauriers (HG), and Sable Island. although not all freshwater sites had higher concentrations compared to marine sites. Dietary tracers [delta(15)N and delta(13)C stable isotopes (Sls)) revealed that PFSA and PFCA exposure is colony dependent. SI signatures suggested that gulls from most marine colony sites were exposed to PFCs via marine prey. The exception was the Mandarte Island colony in Pacific British Columbia, where PFSA and PFCA exposure appeared to be via terrestrial and/or freshwater prey consumption. The same was true for the freshwater sites where egg Sls suggested both aquatic and terrestrial prey consumption as the source for PFC exposure depending on the colony. Both aquatic (marine and freshwater) and terrestrial prey are likely sources of PFC exposure to gulls but exposure scenarios are colony-specific. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Both compounds interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), but it is not known whether activation of PPARs is involved in their embryo toxicity in birds. We exposed chicken embryos via egg injection at a late developmental stage to GW7647, a potent PPAR alpha agonist in mammals, and to PFOS or PFOA. Mortality was induced by PFOS and PFOA but not by GW7647. Transcripts of a number of genes activated by PPAR alpha agonists in mammals were analyzed in liver and kidney of 18-day-old embryos. Several of the genes were induced in both liver and kidney following exposure to GW7647. Treatment with PFOA resulted in induction of acylcoenzyme A oxidase mRNA in liver, whereas none of the genes were significantly induced by PFOS treatment. No up-regulation of gene transcription was found in kidney following treatment with PFOS or PFOA. Principal component analysis showed that PFOA caused an mRNA expression pattern in liver more similar to the pattern induced by GW7647 than PFOS did. Our findings do not support that the embryo mortality by PFOS and PFOA in chicken embryos involves PPAR alpha activation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Cited By :14

Urinalysis revealed one to four target antibiotics in 77.4% of the sample group, with concentrations as high as 0.36 ng/mL. Norfloxacin and penicillin had the highest detection rates (48.4% and 35.5%, respectively), with median concentrations of 0.037 and 0.13 ng/mL, respectively. The VA burden of children in HK was lower than that in Shanghai. Enrofloxacin, penicillin, and erythromycin were the most detected VAs in raw and cooked food. Only oxytetracycline was detected in terminal tap water, and none were detected in milk. Tetracycline and doxycycline hyclate were detected in organic eggs (up to 7.1 ng/g) and regular eggs (up to 6.6 ng/g), which were common in children's diets. Traditional Chinese cooking processes did not completely eliminate VAs, and the concentrations of some VAs increased, especially after frying and roasting. The estimated daily intake (EDI) results show that the contribution of dietary intake and that based on the urine concentrations of VAs were far below the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The EDIs from urine were significantly lower than those based on cooked foods. The highest level of achievement percentage (LAP) based on dietary consumption and urine concentrations were 39.7% and 1.79%, respectively, and thus current levels of exposure to VAs would not seem to pose a risk to children's health. However, harmful effects of residual VAs during developmental periods may occur with exposure to much lower doses than those considered harmful to adults, and further investigation of these emerging pollutants is urgently encouraged.",NA,NA,NA

Nestling peregrines (n = 56; usually two chicks of each sex per nest) were blood sampled when 23 +/- 4 days old in urban and rural regions of the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin (Ontario, Canada) in 2016 and 2018. The circulating concentrations of several PFAAswere significantly associatedwith THs and estimated thyroid gland activity (TT3:TT4; FT3: FT4), including PFHxS (FT3; FT3:FT4), PFDS (TT3; TT3:TT4), PFOA (TT4; FT3:FT4), PFTeDA (TT4; FT3:FT4), PFHxDA (TT4; TT3:TT4) and SPFCAs (TT4). Our novel evaluation ofmiR-155 in peregrine nestlings identified significantly negative relationships of plasmamiR-155 counts with PFHxS and PFOA concentrations, indicating potential down-regulation of miR-155 expression and impaired immunity. Several PFAA homologues significantly predicted the variation in THs and miR-155 in conjunction with year (e.g., inter-annual differences in weather, ambient temperature, rainfall), region (urban/rural), nestling age, and/or diet (trophic position; delta N-15), which suggests thatmultiple environmental and biological stressors, including PFAA exposure, influenced thyroid activity and immune function in these nestlings. Further research is warranted to identify the mechanisms and additional impacts of PFAA-related thyroid and immune disruption on the growth, development, and health risks in developing birds.

Here we use microarrays to survey the transcriptional response of cultured chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEH) to PFUdA for potential targets of PFUdA action that could lead to developmental deficiencies in exposed birds. At 1 mu M and 10 mu M PFUdA significantly altered the expression of 346 and 676 transcripts, respectively (fold-change > 1.5, p < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected). Using functional, pathway and interactome analysis we identified several potentially important targets of PFUdA exposure, including the suppression of the acute-phase response (APR). We then measured the expression of five APR genes, fibrinogen alpha (fga), fibrinogen gamma (fgg), thrombin (f2), plasminogen (plg), and protein C (proC), in the liver of chicken embryos exposed in ovo to PFUdA. The expression of fga, f2, and proC were down-regulated in embryo livers (100 or 1000 ng/g, p < 0.1) as predicted from microarray analysis, whereas fibrinogen gamma (fgg) was up-regulated and pig was not significantly affected. Our results demonstrate the utility of CEH coupled with transcriptome analysis as an in vitro screening tool for identifying novel effects of toxicant exposure. Additionally, we identified APR suppression as a potentially important and environmentally relevant target of PFUdA. These findings suggest in ovo exposure of birds to PFUdA may lead to post-hatch developmental deficiencies, such as impaired inflammatory response. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We observed significant temporal trends of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (∑PFCAs) in all three subpopulations. Concentrations of FOSA and PFOS had started decreasing significantly since the mid-1990s to 2000 in the Greenland and Norwegian subpopulations, consistent with the 3M phase-out, though in sharp contrast to overall increasing trends observed in the Swedish subpopulation. Moreover, ∑PFCA concentrations significantly increased in all three subpopulations throughout the study periods. These temporal trends suggest on-going input of PFOS in the Baltic and of ∑PFCAs in all three regions. Considerable spatial variation in PFAS concentrations and profiles was observed: PFOS concentrations were significantly higher in Sweden, whereas FOSA and ∑PFCA concentrations were similar among the subpopulations. PFOS dominated the PFAS profiles in the Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations, in contrast to the domination of FOSA and ∑PFCAs in the Greenland one.

Similarly to other persistent and bioaccumulative organic contaminants, some PFASs, particularly the long-chain congeners, can be biomagnifled via food webs, making top predators vulnerable to elevated PFAS exposure. In this study, we measured seven classes of PFASs in bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) eggs for the first time. The eggs (n = 22) were collected from the North American Great Lakes in 2000-2012. The ranges of total concentrations of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (Sigma PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (Sigma PFCAs) were 30.5-1650 and 5.4-216 ng/g wet weight (ww), respectively. In addition to these traditional PFAS compounds, 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS; median: 15.7 ng/g ww), perfluoro-4-ethylcyclohexanesulfonic acid (Sigma PFECHS; 0.22 ng/g ww), and 8-chloro-perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (CI-PFOS, detected in wildlife for the first time; 0.53 ng/g ww) were also frequently detected. Bald eagle eggs from breeding areas located less than 8 km from a Great Lake shoreline or tributary had significantly greater total PFAS concentrations (Sigma PFASs) than those from breeding areas located further than 8 km (p < 0.05). In these samples, Sigma PFASs rivalled the total concentration of brominated flame retardants, and were significantly greater than those of several other organic contaminants, such as dechlorane-related compounds, organophosphate esters, and flame retardant metabolites.

Vitellogenin, a yolk precursor, has been suggested to play a role in this transport.        We here report for the first time the temporal changes in OHC and an index of vitellogenin concentrations in female plasma from the pre-laying period to clutch completion in free-living birds: the southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) breeding in the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. In addition, OHC concentrations in the corresponding clutches were analysed. OHC concentrations in female plasma and in the yolk of both the first (A-) and the second (B-)eggs followed a similar pattern, with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) > Sigma polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) > Sigma dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) > Sigma methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) > Sigma chlordanes (CHLs) > Sigma polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) approximate to Sigma hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs). The higher concentrations of MeO-PBDEs compared to PBDEs indicate a diet containing naturally-produced MeO-PBDEs. All OHC compounds except for PBDEs increased from the pre-laying period to A-egg laying and subsequently declined from A-egg laying to B-egg laying, and female plasma vitellogenin showed the same pattern. For EPCBs and Sigma MeO-PBDEs, we found positive correlations between female plasma during A-egg laying and both eggs, and for HCB between female plasma and A-eggs only. During pre-laying, only Sigma MeO-PBDEs correlated between both eggs and female plasma, and no correlations between OHC concentrations in eggs and female plasma were found during B-egg laying, highlighting that maternal transfer of OHCs is time- and compound specific. Finally, female vitellogenin concentrations did not significantly correlate with any OHC compounds in either female plasma or eggs, and our results therefore did not confirm the suggested role of vitellogenin in the maternal transfer of OHC molecules into their eggs.

The birds were then observed for 3 days while being given uncontaminated feed, and half of the birds were sacrificed on Day 8 of the trial. The remaining birds were maintained for an additional two weeks prior to being euthanized on Day 22 of the trial. Birds were assessed for growth, rate of feed consumption, behavior, physical injury, mortality, and gross abnormalities. Liver weight and concentrations of PFOS in blood serum and liver were also assessed. Based on the average daily intake (ADI) of PFOS calculated over the 5-day exposure period, the LD50 for juvenile mallards was determined to be 150 mg PFOS/kg body weight (bw)/day, equivalent to a total cumulative dose of 750 mg PFOS/kg bw calculated over a 5-day period. For juvenile quail, the LD50 based on the ADI was 61 mg PFOS/kg bw/day, equivalent to a total cumulative dose of 305 mg PFOS/kg bw. Reductions in weight gain and body weight were observed in quail from the 141 mg PFOS/kg treatment, but these measures returned to control levels by Day 22. The no-mortality dietary treatments were 70.3 and 141 mg PFOS/kg feed for quail and mallards, respectively. Both mallards and quail accumulated PFOS in blood serum and liver in a dose-dependent manner. The half-lives of PFOS in mallard blood serum and liver were estimated to be 6.86 and 17.5 days, respectively. In quail, the half-life of PFOS in liver was estimated to be 12.8 days, while the half-life of PFOS in quail blood serum could not be estimated.

Linear PFOS (n-perfluoro-1-octanesulfonate (L-PFOS)) consistently dominated the isomer pattern in all eggs, comprising between 95.0% and 98.3% of the Sigma PFOS concentration. L-PFOS was highly enriched in the gull eggs as the Sigma branched-PFOS to L-PFOS isomer concentration ratios were very constant (overall average 0.038 +/- 0.001) and much lower compared to technical PFOS (range 0.27-0.54). The highest proportions of L-PFOS were generally observed in the eggs from the lower lakes (Erie and Ontario) colonies. All six mono(trifluoromethyl) branched isomers, or perfluoro-n-methyl-heptanesulfonates where n describes the carbon of the hydrocarbon chain were there is trifluoromethyl substitution relative to the sulfonate terminal group, were detected in the eggs from all the colonies. For example, P1MHpS is perfluoro-1-methyl-heptanesulfonate. Comparable to technical PFOS (T-PFOS), the percentage of the mono(trifluoromethyl) isomer to Sigma PFOS concentration decreased as the branch substitution was located closer to the sulfonate group, that is, P6MHpS (0%-2.5%), P5MHpS (0.43%-1.18%), P4MHpS (0.25%-0.69%), and P3MHpS (0.32%-0.74%). Although at even lower fractional composition than the mono(trifluoromethyl) isomers, of the di(trifluoromethyl) isomers, detected in >60% of the individual eggs per site was P35DMHxS and P45DMHxS for Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario), P35DMHxS for Chantry (Lake Huron) and Fighting Island (Detroit River), and P45DMHxS for Gull Island (Lake Michigan). Relative to T-PFOS, and independent of colonial location, the high and consistent enrichment of L-PFOS in gull eggs is likely a function of several processes including PFOS or precursor sources, and isomer-specific PFOS or precursor exposure, accumulation, biotransformation, retention and/or elimination. The results of this study suggests that the apparent dilution of the mono(fluoromethyl) isomers from environmental processes that occur prior to final accumulation in herring gull eggs, is independent of the mono(fluoromethyl) isomer structure.",NA,NA,NA

In addition, serum PFOS concentrations were determined by LC/MS/MS. Embryonic day (ED) 0 eggs were injected with either safflower oil/10% DMSO (control, 0 mg/kg egg wt) or PFOS in safflower oil/10% DMSO at 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg egg wt, and the chicks were grown to post-hatch day (PHD) 14.

Right wings were shorter in all treatments compared to control. Increases in the frequency of brain asymmetry were evident in all treatment groups. SRBC-specific immunoglobulin (IgM and IgY combined) titers were decreased significantly at all treatment levels, while plasma lysozyme activity was increased at all treatment levels. The PHA skin test response decreased in relation to increasing PFOS dose.

These concentrations fall within environmental ranges reported in blood samples from wild caught avian species; thereby, verifying that the environmental egg concentrations used for the injections do indeed relate to serum levels in hatchlings that are also environmentally relevant. These data indicate that immune alterations and brain asymmetry can occur in birds following in ovo exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOS and demonstrates the need for further research on the developmental effects of perfluorinated compounds in various species.

Elevated levels of PFOS have been detected in various avian species, and the impact of this on avian health is of interest when determining acceptable levels of PFOS in the environment. Due to its similarities to naturally occurring fatty acids, PFOS has potential to disrupt a range of biological pathways, particularly those associated with lipid metabolism, and this has been shown in various species. In this study, we have investigated how in ovo exposure to environmentally relevant levels of PFOS affects expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism of developing chicken embryos.

In the present study, we examined whether the concentrations of 15 PFAAs in isopods (Oniscidae), collected at a fluorochemical plant and in four other areas, representing a gradient in distance from the pollution source (1 km to 11 km), were related to those in the soil and in eggs of a songbird, the great tit (Paws major), collected in the same areas.

Sixteen PFASs were detected, of which perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant compound, detected in 100% of birds (1.34-13.4 ng/g wet wt). Long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA; <0.04-0.79 ng/g wet wt) and perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA; <0.05-1.6 ng/g wet wt) were detected in >50% of birds. There was a positive correlation between PFDA and PFTrDA concentrations and wing chord length (R-s = 0.36, p = 0.0204; R-s = 0.44, p = 0.0037, respectively), and between PFDA concentrations and total body mass (R-s = 0.33, p = 0.032), suggesting that these compounds may impact shearwater fledgling morphometrics. Plastic was present in the intestinal tract of 79% of individuals (<7.6 g), although there was no correlation between PFAS concentrations and plastic mass, indicating that ingested plastic is not the likely primary exposure source. The widespread occurrence of PFASs in fledgling marine birds from a relatively pristine location in the Southern Hemisphere suggests that further studies in adult shearwaters and other marine birds are warranted to investigate whether there are any long-term physiological effects on bird species.

Several environmental contaminants may act on energy expenditure through their thyroid hormone disrupting properties. However, the effect of contaminants on BMR is still poorly documented for wildlife. Here, we investigated the relationships between three groups of contaminants (organochlorines (OCs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and mercury) with metabolic rate (MR), considered here as a proxy of BMR and also with circulating total THs (thyroxine (TT4) and triiodothyronine (TT3)) in Arctic breeding adult black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) from Svalbard, during the chick rearing period. Our results indicate a negative relationship between the sum of all detected chlordanes (Sigma CHLs) and MR in both sexes whereas perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrA) and MR were positively related in females only. MR was not associated with mercury. Additionally, levels of TT3 were negatively related to Sigma CHLs but not to PFTrA. The findings from the present study indicate that some OCs (in both sexes) and some PFASs (only in females) could disrupt fine adjustment of BMR during reproduction in adult kittiwakes. Importantly, highly lipophilic OCs and highly proteinophilic PFASs appear, at least in females, to have the ability to disrupt the metabolic rate in an opposite way. Therefore, our study highlights the need for ecotoxicological studies to include a large variety of contaminants which can act in an antagonistic manner.",NA,NA,NA

The dominating contaminant in egg was p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) with a geometric mean (GM) concentration of 18 200 ng/g lipid weight (1w). The GM concentration in egg of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) of 140 ng/g lw, was significantly higher than that of polybrominated diphenyl ether (TPBDE) of 77 ng/g 1w.        For the evaluation of the data multivariate data analysis techniques namely principal components analysis (PCA), partial least squares regression (PLS), soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA classification), and PLS discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were used. We investigated whether the eggs' biological characteristics co-varied with egg concentrations of OCs and BFRs, and found e.g., significant negative correlations between egg weight and concentrations of HCB and p,p'-DDE. A PLS model with analyzed BFRs as the Y matrix and OCs as the X matrix could, with varying accuracy, calculate the concentrations of BFRs in the individual egg from their concentrations of OCs (e.g., R-2 Y of 0.89 for BDE47, and of 0.50 for HBCD).        Lastly, we compared the contaminant concentrations in the eggs to those in previously analyzed pectoral muscles from adult guillemots from Stora Karlso, from the year 2000. A PLS-DA model, showed that some of the contaminants (e.g., HBCD and CB28) had significantly higher concentrations in egg than in muscle, although 7 of the 14 contaminants showed no difference in concentrations between the two matrices.

A major PFAS producing facility is located in the Antwerp area and levels of PFASs in biota from that region have been found to be very high in previous studies. We aimed to investigate for the first time the main sources of PFASs in feathers of a terrestrial bird species. Throughout this study, we have used statistical methods for left-censored data to cope with levels below the limit of detection (LOD), instead of traditional, potentially biased, substitution methods.        Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was detected in all tissues (range: 11 ng/g ww in muscle-1208 ng/g ww in preen oil) and in tail feathers (<2.2-56.6 ng/g ww). Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was measured at high levels in feathers (<14-670 ng/g ww), but not in tissues (more than 50%<LOD). Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) could only be quantified in liver and preen oil, while other PFASs were sporadically detected in liver. PFOS levels in feathers and liver were highly correlated (r=0.78, p<0.01), in contrast to PFOA (r= -0.11, p = 0.78). Combined with high PFOA levels in feathers this suggests that PFOA may be present on the external surface of feathers, due to external contamination originating from the air in the vicinity of point sources. Therefore the possibility of using feathers as a passive air sampler for high PFOA levels should be investigated in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Juvenile and adult kestrels accumulated HDBPs in carcass tissue, plasma, and liver. In addition. HDBP's were transferred to yolks during egg development. Low dietary absorption efficiencies (0.011-0.029) indicated that HDBPs were effectively cleared from kestrels either from increased elimination, metabolism, or a combination of the two processes. Reproductive and morphological endpoints examined for HDBP-induced changes included egg volume, egg mass, eggshell thickness, egg fertility, clutch size, liver and whole body mass, antebrachium, central retrice, tarsus, ninth primary, and wing cord lengths. Few statistically significant dose-dependent effects were observed. Hepatic tissue samples from selected individuals underwent histomorphological evaluation. Although the hepatic function was not evaluated specifically in these birds, no clinical signs suggestive of liver disease or gross hepatic anomalies were observed.

We have previously reported that prenatal exposure to PFAS decreased the risk of allergies, while it increased the risk of infectious diseases at ages 2 and 4 years. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse effects of PFAS on allergies and infectious diseases continue until a reliable age of diagnosing allergies. This study aimed at investigating the effects of prenatal exposure to PFAS on the prevalence of allergies and infectious diseases in children up to age 7, from the Hokkaido Study.        Among mother-child pairs enrolled in the Hokkaido study and followed up until the age of 7 years, 2689 participants with maternal PFAS, 1st trimester of pregnancy and 7-year-old questionnaire survey data were included in this study. Eleven PFAS in the 3rd-trimester plasma were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Wheeze, rhino-conjunctivitis, and eczema were defined using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies on Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. History childhood infectious diseases diagnosed by a doctor was assessed by a mother-reported questionnaire at child's age 7. The relative risk of childhood allergies was calculated by generalized estimating equation models. The odds ratio of an episode of infectious diseases was calculated by logistic regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders.        The prevalence of various allergies and infectious diseases was: wheeze, 11.9%; rhino-conjunctivitis, 11.3%; eczema, 21.0%; chickenpox, 61.5%; otitis media, 55.7%; pneumonia, 30.6%; and respiratory syncytial virus infection, 16.8%. Prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and per-fluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with rhino-conjunctivitis, while that for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFUnDA, perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), and per-fluorotridecanoic acid was inversely associated with eczema. For infectious diseases, PFDA and PFDoDA were associated with increased risk of pneumonia and PFOA was associated with increased risk of RSV infection among children not having any siblings (only-one-child).        Our results corroborate the hypothesis on immunosuppressive and immunomodulating effects of PFAS on allergies and infectious diseases in children.

The humic substances included humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA), the protein compounds included chicken egg albumin (albumin) and peptone, and the PFASs included perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid. Four concentrations (0,1,10, and 20 mg L-1) of the four dissolved organic matter (DOM) types were investigated. At the 1 mg L-1 level, HA and albumin enhanced all tested PFAS bioaccumulation, whereas, FA and peptone only enhanced the bioaccumulation of shorter-chain PFASs (PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA). However, all four DOM types decreased all tested PFAS bioaccumulation at the 20 mg L-1 level, and the decreasing ratios of bioaccumulation factors caused by FA, HA, albumin, and peptone were 1-49%, 23-77%, 17-58%, and 8-56%, respectively compared with those without DOM. This is because DOM not only reduced the bioavailable concentrations and uptake rates of PFASs but also lowered the elimination rates of PFASs in D. magna, and these opposite effects would change with different DOM types and concentrations. Although the partition coefficients (L kg(-1)) of PFASs between HA and water (10(4.21)-10(4.98)) were much lower than those between albumin and water (10(4.92)-10(5.86)), their effects on PFAS bioaccumulation were comparable. This study suggests that although PFASs are a type of proteinophilic compounds, humic substances also have important effects on their bioavailability and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.

The results also showed that the gene expression patterns between chickens that were treated with PFOS and those that were treated with PFOA were different, which points to the importance of the separate evaluation of the toxicities of PFOS and PFOA.

Here, we integrate recent data and perform a multi-media assessment to examine the current status and ongoing trends of PFAAs in Canada. Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in air, water, sediment, fish, and birds across Canada are generally related to urbanization, with elevated concentrations observed around cities, especially in southern Ontario. PFOS levels in water, fish tissue, and bird eggs were below their respective Draft Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines, suggesting there is low potential for adverse effects to the environment/organisms examined. However, PFOS in fish and bird eggs tended to exceed guidelines for the protection of mammalian and avian consumers, suggesting a potential risk to their wildlife predators, although wildlife population health assessments are needed to determine whether negative impacts are actually occurring. Long-term temporal trends of PFOS in suspended sediment, sediment cores, Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) eggs collected from Lake Ontario increased consistently from the start of data collection until the 1990s. However, after this time, the trends varied by media, with concentrations stabilizing in Lake Trout and Herring Gull eggs, and decreasing and increasing in suspended sediment and the sediment cores, respectively. For PFCAs, concentrations in suspended sediment, sediment cores, and Herring Gulls generally increased from the start of data collection until present and concentrations in Lake Trout increased until the late 1990s and subsequently stabilized. A multimedia comparison of PFAA profiles provided evidence that unexpected patterns in biota of some of the lakes were due to unique source patterns rather than internal lake processes. High concentrations of PFAAs in the leachate and air of landfill sites, in the wastewater influent/effluent, biosolids, and air at wastewater treatment plants, and in indoor air and dust highlight the waste sector and current-use products (used primarily indoors) as ongoing sources of PFAAs to the Canadian environment. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of integrating data from different media. Simultaneous evaluation of spatial and temporal trends in multiple media allows inferences that would be impossible with data on only one medium. As such, more co-ordination among monitoring sites for different media is suggested for future sampling, especially at the northern sites. We emphasize the importance of continued monitoring of multiple-media for determining future responses of environmental PFAA concentrations to voluntary and regulatory actions.

To date, however, methods for transgenic modification of the avian genome or determining transgenic status of individual birds are scarce. The dual, but interrelated, goals of this research were to: (1) develop a method of detecting stable DNA insertion into Japanese quail; and (2) provide a method for gene location on avian chromosomes. We created Teflon-coated coverslip slides to facilitate laser pressure catapulting of avian chromosomes for DNA amplification and nucleotide sequencing. Transgenic G(2) Japanese quail, containing germline incorporation of proinsulin, were identified by isolation of chromosomes using laser microdissection and laser pressure catapulting. Subsequent amplification of each chromosome identified 2-5 chromosomes with the proinsulin transgene inserted. Nucleotide sequencing of each chromosomal insertion was identical to the proinsulin portion of the original vector. By applying laser pressure catapulting and PCR of individual chromosomes, we were able to determine that the transgene correctly inserted into avian chromosomes and that the majority of the insertions occurred within microchromosomes. Because many potential therapeutic transgenes have similar or nearly identical nucleotide sequence to the host's native gene, laser microdissection and subsequent analysis may be required for detailed documentation of transgene expression before proceeding with transgenic protein production.",NA,NA,NA

There is increasing concern that these agents may be developmental neurotoxicants and the present study was designed to develop an avian model for the neurobehavioral teratogenicity of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Fertilized chicken eggs were injected with 5 or 10 mg/kg of either compound on incubation day 0. On the day of hatching, imprinting behavior was impaired by both compounds. We then explored underlying mechanisms involving the targeting of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma) in the intermedial part of the hyperstriatum ventrale, the region most closely associated with imprinting. With PFOA exposure, cytosolic PKC concentrations were significantly elevated for all three isoforms; despite the overall increase in PKC expression, membrane-associated PKC was unaffected, indicating a defect in PKC translocation. In contrast, PFOS exposure evoked a significant decrease in cytosolic PKC, primarily for the beta and gamma isoforms, but again without a corresponding change in membrane-associated enzyme; this likely partial, compensatory increases in translocation to offset the net PKC deficiency. Our studies indicate that perfluorinated alkyls are indeed developmental neurotoxicants that affect posthatch cognitive performance but that the underlying synaptic mechanisms may differ substantially among the various members of this class of compounds, setting the stage for disparate outcomes later in life.

The highly bioaccumulative perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) as well as other perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) showed the greatest concentrations in eggs from the lower Great Lakes of southern Ontario as well as from the St. Lawrence River. Despite the 2000 to 2002 phase-out of PFOS and related C-8 chemistry by the major manufacturer at the time, ongoing losses from consumer products during use and disposal in urban/industrial locations continue to be major sources to the environment and are influencing the spatial trends of PFOS in Canada. In comparison to PFOS, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were not as concentrated in eggs in close proximity to urbanized/industrialized centers, but had surprisingly elevated levels in relatively remote regions such as Great Slave Lake, NT and East Bay in Hudson Bay, NU. The present results support the hypothesis that atmospheric transport and degradation of precursor chemicals, such as the fluorotelomer alcohols 8:2 FTOH and 10:2 FTOH, are influencing the spatial trends of PFCAs in Canada.

In addition, perfluorinated compounds were measured in livers and eggs of Chinook salmon and lake whitefish, in muscle tissue of carp, and in eggs of brown trout collected from Michigan. Similarly, green frog livers, snapping turtle plasma, mink livers, and bald eagle tissues were analyzed to determine concentrations in higher trophic-level organisms in the food chain. PFOS was the most widely detected compound in benthic organisms at various trophic levels. Concentrations of PFOS in benthic invertebrates such as amphipods and zebra mussels were approximately 1000-fold greater than those in surrounding water, which suggested a bioconcentration factor (BCF; concentration in biota/concentration in water) of 1000 in benthic invertebrates. Concentrations of PFOS in round gobies were two- to fourfold greater than those in their prey organisms such as zebra mussels and amphipods. Concentrations of PFOS in predatory fishes (Chinook salmon and lake whitefish) were 10 to 20-fold greater than those in their prey species. Concentrations of PFOS in mink and bald eagles were, on average, 5- to 10-fold greater than those in Chinook salmon, carp, or snapping turtles. Because of the accumulation of PFOS in liver and blood, the biomagnification factor (BMF) of perfluorinated compounds in higher trophic-level organisms such as salmonid fishes, mink, and eagles were on the concentrations in livers or plasma. Overall, these results suggest a BCF of PFOS of approximately 1000 (whole-body based) in benthic invertebrates, and a BMF of 10 to 20 in mink or bald eagles, relative to their prey items. Eggs of fish contained notable concentrations of PFOS, suggesting oviparous transfer of this compound.

The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s.

Taking into consideration the lifestyle variables, significant associations were found between nonstick cookware and perfluorononanoic acid, between dental floss and cosmetics and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and between leather sofa and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA).

Methods Specimens, either standardized annual pooled samples (blue mussels, eelpout liver, bream liver, pigeon eggs) or individual single samples (cormorant eggs, rook eggs), were collected for the German ESB program from representative sampling sites according to documented guidelines. After appropriate extraction, PFC were quantified under ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation by HPLC/MS-MS with isotopically labeled internal standards. Limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.2-0.5 ng/g. Data are reported on a wet weight basis.        Results and discussion In most samples the predominant PFC was perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). However, in marine mussels from North and Baltic Seas, PFOS levels were mostly below the LOQ, but low residues of PFOS amide were found which declined in recent years. Livers of eelpout showed maximum concentrations of 15-25 ng/g PFOS in the period 2000-2002 and low amounts of perfluoropentanoate in all years. Beside PFOS (median 48 ng/g) several PFC could be determined in cormorant eggs sampled in 2009 from a Baltic Sea site. For a freshwater ecosystem, current PFC burdens for cormorant eggs were even higher (median 400 ng/g PFOS). Livers of bream from rivers showed concentrations of 130-260 ng/g PFOS, but for bream from a reference lake levels were only about 6 ng/g. In contrast to cormorants, eggs of rook and feral pigeon from terrestrial ecosystems displayed only low PFC burdens (up to 6 ng/g PFOS).        Conclusions Generally, PFC levels were lower in marine than in freshwater biota. PFC burdens were higher in biota from the ESB-North Sea sites than in Baltic Sea organisms. Levels of PFC were quite high especially in top predators of both limnetic and marine ecosystems. Only low PFC levels were detected in eggs of terrestrial birds. A decrease of PFOS levels from maximum values around the year 2000 observed at least in North Sea biota may be a result of a production cease and shifts in marketing pattern.",NA,NA,NA

This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic add (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

While previous studies have demonstrated that populations of some organisms proximal to urban centers may display increased burdens of human-created chemicals compared to more distal populations, this relationship may not be universal when applied to organisms and stressors capable of transboundary movements. We examined eggs of brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), a nearshore seabird with daily movements ranging from local to 50 km and annual migrations ranging from year-round residency to 1500 km. Thirty-six eggs from three breeding colonies located at increasing distances to a major urban center (Charleston, South Carolina, USA) were analyzed for concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Areas of high use for each colony during the breeding season were also assessed via the tracking of adult pelicans from each colony using GPS-PTT satellite transmitters and overlapped with measures of relative urbanization via land cover data. We report potentially significant n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations in the eggs of pelicans (175.4 +/- 120.1 ng/g w wt. SD), driven largely by linear perfluorooctane sulfonate (n-PFOS) (48-546 ng/g w wt.). Residues of the precursor compound perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) were also present in pelican eggs, suggesting continued exposure of local wildlife beyond implemented phaseouts of some PFAS. For most analytes, egg concentrations did not exhibit a significant spatial structure despite some differentiation in high-use areas unlike similar data for another regional apex predator, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). We suggest that the partially migratory nature of brown pelicans during the non-breeding season, combined with daily ranges that may extend to 50 km from local point sources, may have homogenized exposure across individuals. Charleston likely remains a major source for PFAS in the overall region, however, given the high concentrations observed as well as known releases of PFAS in the nearshore environment.

Previously, it was demonstrated that in ovo exposure to PFOA induced cardiotoxicity in chicken embryos and hatchlings. To investigate potential PPARα-mediated mechanisms, fertile chicken eggs were injected prior to incubation with WY 14,643, a PPARα agonist. Cardiac morphology and function were evaluated in late-stage embryos and hatchlings. Histologically, unlike PFOA, WY 14,643 did not induce thinning of the right ventricular wall. Via echocardiography, however, WY 14,643 induced effects similar to those of PFOA, including increased left ventricular wall thickness and mass, elevated heart rate, ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and decreased stroke volume. Additionally, to investigate mechanisms associated with early heart development, a separate group of fertile chicken eggs was injected prior to incubation with PFOA or WY 14,643 and in early-stage embryos, gene expression and protein concentration associated with the bone morphogenic protein (BMP2) pathway were determined. Although changes were not statistically consistent among doses, expression of BMP2, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 mRNA in early embryos was altered by PFOA exposure; however, protein concentrations of these targets were not markedly altered by either PFOA or WY 14,643. Protein levels of pSMAD1/5, a transcriptional regulator stimulated by BMPs, were altered by both PFOA and WY 14,643, but in different directions; PFOA reduced cytoplasmic pSMAD1/5, whereas WY 14,643 decreased nuclear pSMAD1/5. Taken together, these data suggest that developmental cardiotoxicity induced by PFOA likely involves both PPARα and BMP2 pathways. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Cited By :19

In the present study, we examined PFAS levels in plasma of white-tailed eagle nestlings from northern Norway over the last decade (2008-2017). While PFOA and PFNA exposure did not follow a significant time trend, PFOS and PFHxS concentrations decreased over time, and >= C-11 perfluorinated carboxylic acids only seem to level off during the last four years. This may in fact be the first evidence for a change in the trend for some of these compounds. Furthermore, since several PFAS are expected to be highly present in aqueous film-forming foams used at airports, we also investigate the potential of the two main airports in the region to act as hotspots for PFAS. Our results indeed show decreasing exposure to PFOA with distance to the airports. Altogether, our results seem to show that legislation actions are effective, and continued concern for PFAS exposure of high trophic wildlife is still warranted, even in the northern environment.",NA,NA,NA

However, it has also been 30 years since organic pollutants as a potential factor have been assessed. We analysed penguin eggs collected in 2011 and 2012 from two breeding colonies 640 km apart: Robben Island near Cape Town on the Atlantic Ocean coast, and Bird Island near Port Elizabeth on the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa. We quantified organochlorine pesticides, brominated flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). Compared to 30 years ago, concentrations of Sigma DDT have remained about the same or slightly lower, while Sigma PCBs declined almost four-fold. The use of DDT in malaria control is unlikely to have contributed. PFCs were detected in all eggs. Indications (non-significant) of eggshell thinning associated with Sigma DDT and Sigma PCB was found. It seems therefore that the concentrations of measured organic pollutants the African Penguin eggs are not contributing directly to its current demise, but concerns remain about thinner shells and desiccation.

Along with white feathers and a black bill and feet, the Fengtou duck has a high feather crest. This breed can be used for ornamental purposes or as a model organism; however, little is known about the genetic basis and development of its distinct morphological features. In this study, we observed the skull and feather crest of Fengtou duck in the embryonic stages. As a result, the protuberances of the head integument could be clearly observed at embryonic stage E9, and small perforations in the skull were first visible at E13 and were clearer at E15. Besides, intracranial fat in a small number of individuals was found starting at E15, and a small number of osteophytes was found at E18. In addition, hematoxylin eosin (HE) and Oil Red-O staining of the crest cushion and intracranial tissue revealed fat tissue accumulation. Previous studies demonstrated that homeobox c8 (HOXC8) played a critical role in chicken crest formation. Here, we cloned the HOXC8 from Fengtou duck and determined that its transcript was highly expressed in the crest cushion; moreover, HOXC8 was detected in this tissue with a molecular weight of 38 kDa in the Fengtou duck. In conclusion, embryos of Fengtou duck have different small protuberances and perforations in the skull, including accumulation of intracranial tissue and osteophytes in some cases. Furthermore, HOXC8 may regulate the formation of the crest. These findings provide novel insight into the ontogenesis of the crest cushion in crested ducks and a basis for future studies on their evolutionary origins.",NA,NA,NA

In general, PFOS is approximately 10 times more toxic than PFOA in these organisms. In M. macrocopa, the median lethal concentration (LC50) was 17.95 mg/L for PFOS and 199.51 mg/L for PFOA. Moina macrocopa exhibited greater sensitivity than D. magna to both perfluorinated compounds in both acute and chronic exposures.

The presence of a pathological pulmonary condition, such as asthma, may increase lung susceptibility to such contaminants.        Objective: This study aimed to investigate if exposure to inhaled ethanol vapors or nano-TiO2 can modulate the rat pulmonary inflammatory response resulting from an allergic asthmatic reaction.        Materials and methods: Brown Norway rats were sensitized (sc) and challenged (15 min inhalation, 14 days later) with chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA). Leukocytes were counted in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) performed at 6, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h following the challenge and either after ethanol exposures (3000 ppm, 6 h/day, daily) or at 48 h (peak inflammation) for nano-TiO2 exposures (9.35 mg/m(3) aerosol for 6 and 42 h after the OVA challenge). For the nano-TiO2 exposures, plasma and BAL cytokines were measured and lung histological analyzes were performed.        Results: Exposure to ethanol did not significantly affect BAL leukocytes after OVA challenge. Exposure to nano-TiO2 significantly decreased BAL leukocytes compared to OVA-challenged controls. Plasma and BAL IL-4, IL-6, and INF-gamma levels were also decreased in the nano-TiO2 group.        Discussion: While ethanol vapors do not modify the pulmonary inflammation in rats during an asthmatic response, a surprising protective effect for agglomerated nano-TiO2 was observed.

One important approach in the development of therapeutics is the use of herbal extracts which are rich in aromatic small molecules. Cinnamomum verum extract (CE) contains proanthocyanidin and cinnamaldehyde, which have been suggested to be capable of directly inhibiting amyloid fibril formation in vitro. This study is aimed at characterizing the inhibitory activity of CE against the fibrillation of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL).        Methods: Acidic pH and high temperatures were used to drive the protein towards amyloid formation. Lysozyme was dissolved at 2 mg/mL in 50mM glycine buffer (pH 2.5), and then incubated at 57 degrees C for the specified durations while stirred gently by Teflon magnetic bars. Various techniques including thioflavin T, fluorescence, Congo red absorbance assay and AFM micrography were used to characterize the HEWL fibrillation processes.        Results: In the absence of CE typical amyloid fibrils (like amyloids formed in Alzheimer disease) became evident after 48 h of incubation. Upon incubation with various extract concentrations in the range of 0.1-1 mg/ml, formation of fibrillar assemblies were significantly inhibited (P<0.05). AFM analysis and MTT assay also confirmed the role of the extract in amyloid inhibition. Our studies showed that the presence of CE did not have any effect on protein stabilization and thus directly interact with amyloid structure and inhibit formation of these structures. Furthermore, a docking experiment showed that a pi-pi interaction may occur between the aromatic component of cinnamaldehyde and W62. Interestingly, W62 is one of the principal aromatic residues that interact with glycine amide, which is an aggregation suppressor of HEWL.        Discussion: These observations suggest that aromatic small molecules of CE may directly insert into amyloidogenic core of early aggregates and inhibit amyloid fibril formation by disrupting the pi-pi interactions.",NA,NA,NA

These chemicals present an environmental and health risk being present in many samples both in wildlife and humans. In this study, we investigate the effect of PFOS on fatty acid β-oxidation in developing chicken embryos. Methods: Fertilized chicken eggs were exposed in ovo to PFOS at day 4 of incubation. On day 10, the eggs were dissected and livers were incubated in vitro with 3H-palmitic acid for 2 h. The media were collected, and after clean up, the amount of tritiated water was measured with liquid scintillation counting to determine the rate of palmitic acid β-oxidation. Results: PFOS was found to induce fatty acid β-oxidation at doses starting from a lowest observed effect level (LOEL) of 0. 1 μg/g egg weight. Maximum induction of 77 % compared to control was seen at 0. 3 μg/g. Conclusions: The administered doses in which effects are seen are around and even lower than the levels that can be found in wild populations of birds. General population human levels are a factor of two to three times lower than the LOEL value of this study. The environmental contamination of PFOS therefore presents a possibility of effects in wild populations of birds. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Cited By :14

Avian embryos develop separately from their mothers, which gives unique possibilities to study effects of chemicals during embryo development with minimal confounding factors from the mother. In this study we explored blood plasma and allantoic fluid from chicken embryos as matrices for revealing metabolic changes caused by exposure to chemicals during embryonic development. Embryos were exposed via egg injection on day 7 to the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and effects on the metabolic profile on day 12 were compared with those caused by GW7647 and rosiglitazone, which are selective agonists to peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor a (PPAR alpha) and PPAR gamma, respectively. Analysis of the metabolite concentrations from allantoic fluid by Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) showed clear separation between the embryos exposed to GW7647, rosiglitazone, and vehicle control, respectively. In blood plasma only GW7647 caused a significant effect on the metabolic profile. PFOA induced embryo mortality and increased relative liver weight at the highest dose. Sublethal doses of PFOA did not significantly affect the metabolic profile in either matrix, although single metabolites appeared to be altered. Neonatal mortality by PFOA in the mouse has been suggested to be mediated via activation of PPAR alpha. However, we found no similarity in the metabolite profile of chicken embryos exposed to PFOA with those of embryos exposed to PPAR agonists. This indicates that PFOA does not activate PPAR pathways in our model at concentrations in eggs and embryos well above those found in wild birds. The present study suggests that allantoic fluid and plasma from chicken embryos are useful and complementary matrices for exploring effects on the metabolic profile resulting from chemical exposure during embryonic development.",NA,NA,NA

Thioflavin T (Th T), which was used widly as a labeling agent for amyloid fibrils, is a traditional probe for the confirmation of amyloid fibril formation. Although the traditional fluorescence spectroscopy measurements are used for monitoring the aggregation reaction, they have no applicability to separation analysis of the amyloid fibrils. In order to understand the fibril formation process, the development of an efficient method that enables to separate and detect the amyloid fibrils is required. In this work, Th T labeling of amyloid fibrils in 1 mM hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) solution was performed following separation of different-sized amyloid fibrils in a PTFE tube (5000 X 0.50 mm i.d.) as a separation field. The fluorescence was monitored at 485 nm, with the maximum excitation wavelength at 435 nm. The novel method's sensitivity for the detection of amyloid fibrils was high and compared well with the traditional fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. In addition, the developed method detected more than 5 peaks within 20 mM under the optimum separation conditions.

The initiation process was probed with time- and wavelength-resolved emission spectroscopy. Teflon particle and Teflon foil samples without Al fuel were also studied. During similar to 15 ns duration shocks produced by 50 mu m thick flyers, Teflon was heated to a greater extent than Al. Al/Teflon underwent explosive chemical reactions lasting similar to 500 ns at an impact velocity threshold of 1.0 +/- 0.1 km/s. The Teflon samples emitted a continuum spectrum attributed to triboluminescence. C-2 emission (Swan bands) from the powder Teflon could be detected at impact velocities of 0.7 km/s, after a few microseconds, presumably from gases trapped between the decomposing sample and the observation window, indicating that Teflon can be at least partially decomposed to carbon and fluorine. During the 15 ns shock, the Al/Teflon had almost the same emission temporal and spectral profile and absolute emission intensity as Teflon alone. At the end of the shock, the Al/Teflon exploded twice in succession, creating intense emission bursts much stronger than those from Teflon alone. Each of the two explosions had an abrupt onset of similar to 10 ns, and each lasted 100-200 ns. The first explosion was associated with the arrival of the compressive release wave and the second, whose emission burst was similar to 1/3 as intense as the first, with the arrival of shear release waves from the flyer plate edges. For Al/Teflon to react, the Al fuel nanospheres must be released from their passivating oxide shells. The abrupt onset of the two explosions led us to propose a mechanism where tensile stresses resulting from compressive and shear waves cause the Al shells to crack open, allowing hot Teflon to react with Al. A limited number of studies using 25 mu m thick flyers, which produced 8 ns shocks, show that the pressure threshold for initiation was about twice as large as with 15 ns shocks.","Cited By :37

This study established an in ovo peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) silencing model in chicken embryo heart, and investigated the role of PPAR alpha in PFOA induced developmental cardiotoxicity. The in ovo silencing was achieved by introducing lentivirus expressing PPAR alpha siRNA into ED2 chicken embryo via microinjection (0.05 ul/g egg weight). Transfection efficacy was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy and western blotting. To assess the developmental cardiotoxicity, cardiac function (heart rate) and morphology (right ventricular wall thickness) were measured in D1 hatchling chickens. 2 mg/kg (egg weight) PFOA exposure at ED0 induced significant elevation of heart rate and thinning of right ventricular wall thickness in D1 hatchling chickens. PPAR alpha silencing did not prevent PFOA-induced elevation of heart rate; however, it did significantly increase the right ventricular wall thickness as compared to PFOA exposed animals. Meanwhile, PPAR alpha silencing did not abolish the protective effects exerted by exposure to 100 mg/kg (egg weight) L-carnitine. In conclusion, PFOA-induced heart rate elevation is likely PPAR alpha independent, while the right ventricular wall thinning seems to be PPAR alpha dependent. The protective effects of L-carnitine do not require PPAR alpha.",NA,NA,NA

We used an avian model (Gallus gallus domesticus) for in ovo treatment at two levels of PFOS. The lipid profile of the liver of the embryo was investigated by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Over 170 lipids were identified, covering phospholipids, ceramides, di- and triacylglycerols, cholesterol esters and fatty acid composition of the lipids. The PFOS exposure caused dose dependent changes in the lipid levels, which included upregulation of specific phospholipids associated with the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway, triacylglycerols with low carbon number and double bond count as well as of lipotoxic ceramides and diacylglycerols.

Different hypotheses about sources of variation in perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) concentrations were examined in eggs (n=107) of tawny owls (Strix aluco) collected over a 24-yr period (1986-2009) in Norway. Predictor variables included the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), temperature, snow, food availability (vole abundance), and individual traits such as age, body condition, and clutch size. Concentrations of both perfluoro-octane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) varied several fold in the population, both inter- and intra-annually. Moreover, individuals laid eggs with several times higher or lower PFAS concentrations within few years (1 yr-5 yr). After controlling for temporal trends (i.e., declining PFOS and increasing PFCA concentrations), both PFOS and PFCAs were positively associated to the winter NAO in the previous year (NAO(y - 1)), suggesting that atmospheric transport may be affecting the input of PFASs to the local ecosystem. Perfluoro-octane sulfonate was negatively related to temperature, but the pattern was complex as there was an interaction between temperature and the feeding conditions. The PFOS accumulation was highest in years with high vole abundance and low to medium temperatures. For PFCAs, there was an interaction between NAO(y - 1) and feeding conditions, suggesting that strong air transport toward Norway and high consumption of voles led to a moderate increase in PFCA accumulation. The individual traits, however, had very little impact on the concentrations of PFASs in the eggs. The present study thus suggests that annual variation in environmental conditions influences the concentrations of PFASs in a terrestrial raptor such as the tawny owl.

High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww).

In this study, blood serum concentrations of 12 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were measured in 40 cardinals from Atlanta and 17 cardinals from the Big Island (Hawaii), HI. We observed significantly higher median concentrations of four PFASs and significantly higher detection frequencies of seven PFASs in the cardinals from Atlanta, relative to the PFAS median concentrations and detection frequencies observed in the cardinals from Hawaii (alpha = 0.05). Among the PFASs measured, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was observed in the highest concentrations.

The best fitting was provided by a simple pseudo monocompartmental first-order kinetics model, regulated by two rates, with a pseudo first-order dissipation half-life of 230 days, accounting for real elimination as well as binding of PFOS to non-exchangeable structures. The calculated assimilation efficiency was 0.66 with confidence intervals of 0.64 and 0.68. The model calculations confirmed that the measured maximum concentrations were still far from the steady state situation, which for this dose regime, was estimated at a value of about 65 mg PFOS/L serum achieved after a theoretical 210 weeks continuous exposure. The results confirm a very different kinetics than that observed in single-dose experiments confirming clear dose-related differences in apparent elimination rates in birds, as described for humans and monkeys; suggesting that a capacity-limited saturable process should also be considered in the kinetic behavior of PFOS in birds. Pseudo first-order kinetic models are highly convenient and frequently used for predicting bioaccumulation of chemicals in livestock and wildlife; the study suggests that previous bioaccumulation models using half-lives obtained at high doses are expected to underestimate the biomagnification potential of PFOS. The toxicokinetic parameters presented here can be used for higher-tier bioaccumulation estimations of PFOS in chickens and as surrogate values for modeling PFOS kinetics in wild bird species.

In addition, the discovery of new PFAS alternatives in the environment has led to growing concern about the presence of numerous other PFAS that are used unrestricted. Feathers have been successfully applied as non-destructive indicators for various contaminants, mostly metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), whereas their suitability as an indicator for PFAS is still discussed. Previous studies on PFAS in feathers have focused primarily on perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs); analytical methods for other groups of PFAS or PFAS alternatives in feathers are still lacking. Hence, this study aimed to develop a rapid, sensitive and reliable analytical method for determining a broad range of PFAS (N = 32) in feathers, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). An extraction duration of 24 h was found to be sufficient to extract the majority of PFAS from the feathers. The extraction recovery of the internal standards ranged on average from 68% (PFBA) to 97% (PFOS). The spike recovery was within an acceptable range of at least 70% for most of the target analytes and the precision was often > 80%. A further extract clean-up using weak anion exchange (WAX) solid phase extraction (SPE), was proven unnecessary, as it resulted in a similar or lower spike recovery, and, as a consequence, a lower precision and higher quantification limit. The analytical method allows detection of low PFAS concentrations in a low quantity of matrix (i.e. small feathers).

Electrocardiography and histological methods were utilized to assess the cardiac function and morphology in hatchling chickens, respectively. Consistent with previous results, 2 mg/kg PFOA exposure at EDO significantly elevated heart rate and thinned right ventricular wall in hatchling chickens, while L-carnitine co-treatment reverted such changes. BMP2 silencing induced very similar changes in hatchling chicken hearts as PFOA exposure, while co-exposure of recombinant BMP2 protein alleviated PFOA-induced changes. L-carnitine exposure alleviated the BMP2-silencing induced changes as well. Western blotting revealed that PFOA exposure enhanced BMP2 expression and suppressed pSMAD1 expression in ED15 chicken embryo hearts, while both changes were reverted by L-carnitine coexposure. Furthermore, silencing of BMP2 significantly increased the expression level of PPAR alpha in ED15 chicken embryo hearts, while silencing of PPAR alpha did not have significant impact on BMP2 expression. In conclusion, BMP2/pSMAD1 signaling participates in the PFOA-induced developmental cardiotoxicity in chicken embryo, which is likely located upstream of PPAR alpha for this particular endpoint. Protection of BMP2 signaling might contribute to L-carnitine mediated protection against PFOA-induced developmental cardiotoxicity.",NA,NA,NA

PFOA and Cd exposure increased mortality and induced malformations, mainly in the cephalic region, the neural tube, and the ventral body wall. After mixed exposure the effect was observed mostly in the neural tube and the cephalic region. However, the mechanism remains unknown. Because of the resemblance between human and chick development, it was possible to correlate the observed alterations in chickens with known human congenital malformations.

EROD activity and porphyrin accumulation permitted the ranking of colonies based on the efficacy of eliciting an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated response. An avian ToxChip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array provided more exhaustive coverage in terms of potential toxicity pathways being affected, including xenobiotic and lipid metabolism and the thyroid hormone pathway. Herring gull eggs from Channel Shelter Island (CHSH, Lake Huron) and Gull Island (GULL, Lake Michigan) had among the highest OHC burdens, and extracts elicited a biochemical and transcriptomic response greater than that of extracts from the other three, less polluted colonies. For example, EROD EC50 values and porphyrin ECthreshold values were lower for CHSH and GULL extracts than for the other colonies. Extracts from CHSH and GULL altered 15 and 13 of 27 genes on the PCR array compared to no more than eight genes for the less contaminated sites. The combination of a well-established avian in vitro assay, two well-characterized biochemical assays, and the avian ToxChip PCR array permitted the geographical discrimination of variably contaminated herring gull eggs from the Great Lakes.

We compare concentrations of legacy and emerging contaminants and metals in blood and eggs between two herring gull colonies located 51 km apart, in the urban influenced Norwegian Oslofjord. While both colonies are within an urbanised area, the inner fjord is more so, as it is surrounded by Oslo, the capital and largest city in Norway Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen indicated a more marine ecological niche in the outer than the inner fjord colony, although with overlap. Persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations were similar in the inner and outer fjord colonies, while the short-chained chlorinated paraffins (SCCP), which are recently added to the Stockholm convention and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) varied, with higher concentrations of SCCP and the cVMS decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) in females and eggs of the inner fjord colony. Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) concentrations were higher in the outer fjord colony, likely linked to releases from a point-source (airport and waste management facility with open access to food waste).

Maternal transfer, assessed by egg to blood ratios, of cVMSs were similar to the POPs with mean log ratio 0.39 (D5), while it was lower for SCCPs, with log ratios-0.77. Our results indicate comparable POP exposure of the herring gulls in the inner and outer Oslofjord, likely due to overlap in ecological niches between the colonies and wide distribution of POPs. The differences between the colonies in concentrations of PFAS, cVMS and CPs shows that point source exposures and urban influence may be more important than ecological niche for these compounds.",NA,NA,NA

In order to help the Chinese government to establish a food traceability system (FTS), the authors conducted the present research which aims to investigate the acceptability of certified traceable (CT) food among Chinese consumers.        Design/methodology/approach - A survey consisting of face-to-face interviews with 1,757 consumers from 13 cities in the Jiangsu Province of China was used. The 13 cities fell into three different categories according to their levels of economic development. The acceptance and purchase of CT food were compared and analyzed in the three levels of consumers. The factors affecting consumer unwillingness to purchase CT food were obtained by factor analysis.        Findings - After the respondents were fully informed about FTS, their acceptance level for CT food significantly increased. The respondents who were willing to buy CT food particularly preferred milk, eggs, and honey as well as meats such as pork, beef, mutton, chicken and duck. Of the total respondents, 68 per cent stated that they would be willing to pay extra for CT food. The main factors affecting consumer unwillingness to buy CT food were: lack of familiarity with CT food and doubt about its function, preference for direct and concise food quality labels, and worries regarding excessively high prices.        Practical implications - Ultimately, it is hoped to improve the overall safety of food in China and potentially worldwide. The Chinese government has to ensure the effectiveness of the FTS, to increase public knowledge about the FTS, to allocate government funds for the establishment of a FTS, and to give extra support to underdeveloped regions. These are the key issues that the Chinese government faces in establishing and popularizing the food traceability system.        Originality/value - This paper researched the acceptability of CT food among Chinese consumers and the factors preventing its acceptance. It provides valuable information for developing countries while seeking to raise China's food safety levels.",NA,NA,NA

Four different extraction methods were tested to conduct HPLC-MS-TOF analysis of some of the most common veterinary drugs used in livestock in Spain. The method deemed most viable was a simple extraction, using methanol and 100 mu L of plasma, that allowed quantification of seven antibiotics (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, sulfadiazine) and five nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (meloxicam, flunixin, carprofen, tolfenamic acid, phenylbutazone).

Livestock and poultry meats (chicken, beef, mutton) account for a significant proportion of dietary consumption in China, and thus it is crucial to investigate the levels and composition profiles of PFCs in consumer meats to assess and mitigate potential health risks. However, rapid and simple analytical methods for such investigations are lacking. This study addresses this shortcoming by developing a rapid filtration clean-up method using carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CMWCNTs) for the detection of 14 PFCs. Good linearities (R2 > 0.99) were obtained for all 14 PFCs in chicken, beef, and mutton. Recoveries ranged from 65 to 145% (except perfluorotetradecanoic acid, PFTeDA) with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 16%. Method limits of detection (LODs) were between 0.12 and 0.83 ng g- 1d.w. Subsequently, this method was applied for the analysis of 46 livestock and poultry meat samples collected from markets in Shanghai. PFCs were detected in all samples with total concentrations of 1.61-4.27 ng g-1 wet weight (w.w) in chicken, 1.51-5.56 ng g-1 w.w in beef and 1.61-8.15 ng g-1 w.w in mutton. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were the predominant compounds in these samples and accounted for over 92% of sigma PFCs. For regulated compounds such as PFOA, risk quotients (RQs) were determined to be much lower than 1. This suggests that chicken, beef, and mutton from Shanghai market pose very low PFC exposure risk to residents. However, high detection frequency of the unregulated PFBA demands further investigation of short-chain PFCs in consumer meats.",NA,NA,NA

In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). Recent studies indicate that along with PPAR alpha other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPAR alpha (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPAR alpha target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PEAAs indicated that PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish.

Most notably, nest temperature was negatively correlated with the concentrations of the sum of (Sigma) DDT, Sigma PCB and several quantitatively minor POP classes within the incubating parent. To investigate the relationship between incubation ability and parental POP exposure further, we experimentally increased the costs of incubation by artificially increasing the clutch size from two to four eggs. Clutch enlargement was followed by a decrease in nest temperature, but this drop in temperature was not associated with POP concentrations within the incubating parent. However, males, which had higher POP concentrations and lower white blood cell counts than females, seemed less able to maintain nest temperature. There was virtually no evidence to suggest that Sigma PCB or Sigma DDT were associated with changes in the time a bird spent incubating. However, there was some indication that nest site attendance by nonincubating males was negatively related to Sigma DDT, suggesting that nest protection may have been compromised. The results suggest that adverse effects of parental POP exposure may occur through suboptimal thermal conditions for embryo development and possibly increased egg predation risk.

PFOS acts as a peroxisome proliferator in rodents, which occurs subsequent to activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Activated PPAR-alpha up-regulates PPAR-a target genes, most of which are involved in lipid metabolism. Although several studies have investigated the effects of PFOS exposure on mammalian gene expression, there are few studies in avian species. To determine if PFOS is capable of activating avian PPAR-alpha, we exposed chicken embryo primary hepatocyte cultures (N=3 independent cell cultures) to PFOS or fenofibrate, a mammalian PPAR-alpha agonist, and examined the expression of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-alpha target genes using quantitative real-time PCR. The target genes examined were peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), enoyl-Coenzyme A, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl Coenzyme A dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme (BIEN), peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl thiolase (PKT), and malic enzyme (ME).

PPAR-alpha mRNA expression was not altered by PFOS or fenofibrate. This study provides the first evidence that PFOS can induce PPAR-alpha-dependent transcriptional responses in an avian species and provides the first characterization of fenofibrate induced transcriptional responses in chicken embryo hepatocyte cultures.

rayyan-830249038,"Reviewing the relevance of dioxin and PCB sources for food from animal origin and the need for their inventory, control and management",2018,NA,NA,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"[""2190-4707"", ""2190-4715""]",30,NA,NA,"Weber, R and Herold, C and Hollert, H and Kamphues, J and Blepp, M and Ballschmiter, K",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Background: In the past, cases of PCDD/F and PCB contamination exceeding limits in food from animal origin (eggs, meat or milk) were mainly caused by industrially produced feed. But in the last decade, exceedances of EU limit values were discovered more frequently for PCDD/Fs or dioxin-like(dl)-PCBs from free range chicken, sheep, and beef, often in the absence of any known contamination source.        Results: The German Environment Agency initiated a project to elucidate the entry of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in food related to environmental contamination. This paper summarizes the most important findings. Food products from farm animals sensitive to dioxin/PCB exposure-suckling calves and laying hens housed outdoor-can exceed EU maximum levels at soil concentrations that have previously been considered as safe. Maximum permitted levels can already be exceeded in beef/veal when soil is contaminated around 5 ng PCB-TEQ/kg dry matter (dm). For eggs/broiler, this can occur at a concentration of PCDD/Fs in soil below 5 ng PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ/kgdm. Egg consumers-especially young children-can easily exceed health-based guidance values (TDI). The soil-chicken egg exposure pathway is probably the most sensitive route for human exposure to both dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs from soil and needs to be considered for soil guidelines. The study also found that calves from suckler cow herds are most prone to the impacts of dl-PCB contamination due to the excretion/accumulation via milk. PCB (and PCDD/F) intake for free-range cattle stems from feed and soil. Daily dl-PCB intake for suckler cow herds must in average be less than 2 ng PCB-TEQ/day. This translates to a maximum concentration in grass of 0.2 ng PCB-TEQ/kgdm which is less than 1/6 of the current EU maximum permitted level. This review compiles sources for PCDD/Fs and PCBs relevant to environmental contamination in respect to food safety. It also includes considerations on assessment of emerging POPs.        Conclusions: The major sources of PCDD/F and dl-PCB contamination of food of animal origin in Germany are (1) soils contaminated from past PCB and PCDD/F releases; (2) PCBs emitted from buildings and constructions; (3) PCBs present at farms. Impacted areas need to be assessed with respect to potential contamination of food-producing animals. Livestock management techniques can reduce exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs. Further research and regulatory action are needed to overcome gaps. Control and reduction measures are recommended for emission sourcesand new listed and emerging POPs to ensure food safety.",NA,NA,NA

In this study, time trends, 1971-2001, of bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone (BCPS) and of methylsulfonyl-substituted metabolites of PCBs and 4,4'-DDE, were investigated in eggs of guillemot (Uria aalge) hatching in the Baltic Proper. Temporal trends of PCBs, trans-nonachlor, beta-HCH, 4,4'-DDT, and 4,4'-DDE were also assessed. Tris(4-chlorophenyl) methane (TCPMe), a 4,4'-DDT by-product, was detected in the eggs. The concentration of BCPS ranged between 2.6-0.76 mu g/g on a lipid weight basis over the three decades and showed a significant 1.6% annual decrease. Three metabolites of PCBs, i.e. 3'-MeSO2-CB101, 4'-MeSO2-CB101 and 4-MCSO2-CB149, were quantified in all samples over time and showed an annual decrease of approximately 3% compared to MeSO2-DDE with a decrease of 8.9%. The methylsulfonyl-PCB and -DDE metabolites are eliminated more slowly than the persistent PCB congeners and 4,4'-DDE. Trans-nonachlor decreases by 16% compared to 19% and 9% for 4,4'-DDT and beta-HCH, respectively. The concentration of TCPMe in guillemot decreased by 8.2% per year. A linear relationship was found between TCPMe and 4,4'-DDE concentrations which supports the theory that TCPMe has an origin as a contaminant in commercial 4,4'-DDT products. The very slow decrease in BCPS concentrations is notable and remains to be explained. BCPS is still present at rather high concentrations in the guillemot eggs. The enantiomeric fraction varied between 0.27 and 0.67 which indicates less of a specific retention of the chiral MeSO2-PCBs in guillemot eggs than in grey seal tissues, for example. Independent of meta- or para-substitution of the sulfone group, the most accumulative atropisomer of each of four MeSO2-PCB pairs has been assigned an absolute R structure. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a dearth of environmental information on the isomeric profile of PFOS, especially in biological samples, which requires suitable analysis methods for the identification and quantification of ultratrace amounts. In the present study, a novel method was developed that incorporates clean up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) WAX cartridges and in-port derivatization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to identify and quantitatively determine linear PFOS (L-PFOS) and branched (monotrifluoromethyl and bistrifluoromethyl) isomers in PFOS technical product and in environmentally relevant biological samples. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) was used for derivatization via an in situ pyrolytic alkylation reaction that occurred in the GC injector and generated butyl PFOS isomer derivatives. In addition to L-PFOS, ten branched PFOS isomers were identified in the technical product. The environmental relevance of branched PFOS isomers in addition to L-PFOS was evidenced by the presence of six branched and L-PFOS in representative herring gull and double-crested cormorant egg, and polar bear liver and plasma samples from the Great Lakes and Arctic, respectively. For all PFOS isomers in the technical product and biota samples the method demonstrated high sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 ng/mL, with exception of L-PFOS where the LOD was 1.46 ng/mL.

However, fundamental information regarding the impact of isolation and culture procedures on PFO integrity is lacking. This study describes the isolation and culture of PFOs from mature turkeys and the effects of these procedures on PFO morphology and germinal vesicle (GV) integrity. To isolate PFOs, ovarian cortex was incubated in trypsin-EDTA alone or further incubated in collagenase plus hyaluronidase (CH). About 200 to 500 PFOs, ranging in size from less than 100 mu m in diameter to 1,000 mu m, were recovered from each ovary. The culture of PFOs less than 100 mu m in diameter for 4 h resulted in blebbing of the oolemma followed by extrusion of ooplasm. Primary follicular oocytes 100 to 250 mu m in diameter survived culture for 24 h whereas larger PFOs survived for up to 7 d. Those PFOs with intact granulosa cell investments survived longer than those fully or partially denuded of granulosa cells with CH. Co-culture of PFOs (100 to 250 mu m in diameter) on a monolayer of granulosa cells derived from mature, yellow-yolk follicles augmented PFO survival rates. The rate of GV breakdown was not influenced by the isolation or culture of the PFO.

It is detectable in late stage chicken embryos and hatchling chickens. To investigate mechanism(s) of cardiotoxicity, primary cultures of cardiomyocytes were prepared from 10-day-old chicken embryos that were (A) pre-exposed to vehicle or 2 mg of PFOA/kg of egg weight in ovo or (B) incubated with PFOA in vitro at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mu g/mL in medium for 1 or 36 h. When viability was assessed, survival of cardiomyocytes prepared from pre-exposed embryos did not differ from vehicle controls, even under conditions of serum starvation designed to challenge the cells. However, 1 h of exposure to 100 mu g/mL of PFOA in vitro and 36 h of exposure to 75 and 100 mu g/mL PFOA in vitro decreased viability. When contractility was evaluated, cardiomyocytes cultured from pre-exposed embryos exhibited decreases in time to maximum departure velocity and cell length at peak contraction, whereas cardiomyocytes exposed in vitro exhibited a reduction in the 50% relaxation time at a concentration of 1 mu g/mL relative to vehicle controls. Morphological assessment revealed decreased cardiomyocytes axial length following in ovo PFOA exposure and 24 h in vitro PFOA 50 mu g/mL exposure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was evaluated only in cardiomyocytes exposed to PFOA in vitro, was significantly elevated following incubation with 50 mu g/mL of PFOA for 1 h. These data indicate that while in vitro exposure to relatively high concentrations of PFOA can induce cytotoxicity and ROS, developmental cardiotoxicity observed in ovo is not likely mediated via PFOA-induced overt cytotoxicity, but likely by altering early cardiac morphologic and function processes.

Inspection of the animal room revealed that approximately 50% of the heat lamp bulbs in the brooder cage were coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Two published case reports detail similar experiences in birds exposed to PTFE-coated heat-lamp bulbs. Birds are highly sensitive to inhaled toxicants owing to the high efficiency of their respiratory systems, and PTFE toxicosis is known to cause pulmonary edema and hemorrhage in pet birds after exposure to overheated nonstick cookware. In the present case, the bulbs were replaced, and no similar problems subsequently have been noted.

To evaluate the developmental cardiotoxicity, fertile chicken eggs were exposed to 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 mg/kg PFOA via air cell injection. Furthermore, exposure to 2 mg/kg PFOA, with or without 100 mg/kg LC were applied to investigate the effects of LC supplement. The results of functional and morphological assessments confirmed PFOA induced developmental cardiotoxicity in chicken embryo, which could be alleviated by co-exposure to LC. LC-MS/MS results also revealed remarkable decrease in LC, ALC and PLC levels in embryonic day six (ED6) chicken embryo hearts as well as LC level in embryonic day fifteen (ED15) chicken embryo hearts following developmental exposure to 2 mg/kg PFOA. Meanwhile, co-exposure to 100 mg/kg LC significantly elevated the levels of LC, ALC and PLC in chicken embryo hearts. Significantly elevated expression level of carnitine acetyltransferase (CRAT) in PFOA-exposed ED6 chicken embryo hearts was observed via western blotting, while LC co-exposure counteracted such changes.

In the present study, a rapid, efficient lipid freeze-filtration extraction method was used to prepare extracts from double-crested cormorant eggs collected from 5 breeding colonies that had variable organohalogen contaminant burdens. Extracts, solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, were administered to chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEHs) to determine effects on cell viability, 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and messenger RNA expression using a chicken ToxChip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. The EROD median effect concentration (EC50) values were lower for extracts with greater organohalogen contaminant burdens and thus permitted an initial ranking of colonies based on the efficacy of eliciting an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated response. The ToxChip PCR array data provided a more exhaustive, pathway-based evaluation of extract effects; variability in the transcriptomic profiles was associated with organohalogen contaminant burdens. For example, extracts from Mud Island (Detroit River, MI, USA) had among the highest organohalogen contaminant burdens and elicited a greater biochemical (EROD EC50 = 0.005) and transcriptomic response (22/43 genes altered on the array) in CEHs compared with the least contaminated site, which was Mandarte Island (BC, Canada; EROD EC50 = 0.172; 8/43 genes altered).

Additionally, dog sera samples representing pet animals were also employed for analysis. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most prominent contaminant found in farm and pet animals, with mean sera PFOS concentrations (in decreasing order) of: chicken (5.8 ng/ml) > cattle (3.0 ng/ml) > goat (2.4 ng/ml) > horse (0.71 ng/ml) > pig (0.37 ng/ml).

The high levels of PFOS found in cattle fetal livers suggest that PFOS crosses the placental barrier to enter fetal circulation. The consumption of chicken by humans might produce higher PFOS exposure in humans compared to that in farm animals; however, the current levels of PFOS in farm animals in Japan were lower than those reported in fish and wild animals.

Magnetic NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption (BET surface area) and SQUID magnetometer. Structure analyses indicated that TiO2/Fe3O4 NPs presented a core-shell structure with a TiO2 (anatase) coating wrapped around the magnetic iron oxide surface. TiO2/SiO2/Fe3O4 NPs showed a ternary structure with a core of Fe3O4, a SiO2 mesosphere and a TiO2 (anatase) crust. Both types of NPs exhibited magnetic properties with saturation magnetization about 40 emu/g and low remanent magnetization and coercivity. Stability of TiO2/SiO2/Fe3O4 NPs in an aqueous solution under UV illumination was better than that of TiO2/Fe3O4 NPs as the presence of the insulation SiO2 layer prevented photodissolution of iron. Both catalysts showed the ability to catalyze the photodegradation of acetaminophen and other four pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (antipyrine, caffeine, metoprolol and bisphenol A) from an aqueous solution. In terms of catalytic activity the synthesized magnetic NPs were almost comparable to the commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 photocatalyst. In addition, the easily recoverable magnetic photocatalysts showed good reusability, especially in the case of TiO2/SiO2/Fe3O4 NPs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

The ROS and NO levels in chicken embryo hearts were determined with electron spin resonance (ESR), and the protein levels of the nuclear factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) p65 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in chicken embryo hearts were assessed with western blotting. The results of ESR indicated that PFOA exposure induced an elevation in the ROS levels in ED19 chicken embryo hearts and hatchling chicken hearts, while L-carnitine could alleviate such changes. Meanwhile, increased NO levels were observed in ED19 embryo hearts and hatchling hearts following PFOA exposure, while L-carnitine co-treatment exerted modulatory effects. Western blotting revealed that p65 translocation in ED19 embryo hearts and hatchling hearts was enhanced by PFOA, while L-carnitine co-treatment alleviated such changes. iNOS expression levels in ED19 embryo hearts followed the same pattern as NO levels, while a suppression of expression was observed in hatchling hearts exposed to PFOA. ROS/NF-kappa B p65 and iNOS/NO seem to be involved in the late stage (ED19 and post hatch) of PFOA-induced developmental cardiotoxicity in a chicken embryo. L-carnitine could exert anti-oxidant and NO modulatory effects in the developing chicken embryo hearts, which likely contribute to its cardioprotective effects.",NA,NA,NA

Concentrations of Sigma DDT and other pollutants were in the same range as eggs from elsewhere, where there were no mortalities. Concentrations of Sigma DDT in eggs from healthy Australian crocodiles were of the same orders of magnitude as the current study, making it highly unlikely that the concentrations of pollutants measured in the present study would have caused or substantially contributed towards the mortalities observed.

Two PFC were tested for the 30-min experiment: perfluorohexane (FC-72) and perfluorobutyltetrahydrofurane (FC-80). For the 3-h experiment, these PFC plus bis-1,2-(F-butyl)-ethene (F-44E) were studied. The PFC were emulsified with an equal volume of a standard aqueous salt diluent, Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender (BPSE). The BPSE alone was used as a control in both experiments. Semen was diluted 1:2 with oxygen-saturated extender and stored in closed tubes at 20 to 30 C prior to insemination.

Immunomodulation is among the most concerning of toxic effects linked with PFAS exposure in mammalian models. However, no studies had yet shown this to be true in birds. Thus, we designed and conducted the first study to determine if PFASs could cause immunomodulation in birds. Secondly, we wanted to determine the effects on an avian host when exposed not only to immunomodulating chemicals, but also to a viral challenge. The aim, to determine if PFAS mediated immunmodulation functionally affects a pathogen challenge for a host. As innate immune system signalling pathways initiate crucial responses against a pathogen challenge, and are lesser studied than their adaptive counterparts, we focused on these pathways. To provide the first information on this, an in vitro experiment was designed and performed using chicken embryo fibroblasts exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (22ppm) and immune markers characterised before and after being infected with gallid herpesvirus-2 (GaHV-2).ResultsThe expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-B), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4) were investigated in various scenarios. These results showed that exposure to PFOS decreased immune gene expression in chicken fibroblasts from 36h post-exposure. Next, it was shown that this decrease could be mitigated by infection with gallid herpesvirus-2, which increased gene expression back to the baseline/control levels.ConclusionsNot only is this the first study to provide the expected evidence that PFOS has immunomodulatory potential in birds, it also provides unexpected data that virus infections can mitigate this negative effect. Thereby, further research, including in vivo and in situ studies, on the impact of PFOS on host-virus interactions is now warranted, as it has been overlooked and might contribute to our understanding of recent disease outbreaks in wildlife. The mechanisms by which gallid herpesvirus mitigates immunomodulation were beyond the scope of this study, but are now of interest for future study.",NA,NA,NA

PCBs were the most abundant contaminants in female blue tits and their eggs, followed by OCPs and PBDEs. Among the OCPs, p,p'-DDE was the most dominant compound and accounted for more than 80% of the sum OCPs.

Despite the fact that there were laying order effects in blue tit clutches, the variance in concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs was larger among clutches than within clutches. Variance in OCP concentrations among clutches was similar to the variance within clutches. These results suggest that one randomly collected blue tit egg from a clutch is useful as biomonitoring tool for PCBs and PBDEs, while for OCP's it is recommended to consistently use the same egg from the laying sequence as a biomonitoring tool. Lipid-normalized concentrations of sum PCBs, sum OCPs and sum PBDEs in female blue tits after clutch completion were comparable to the concentrations in the first-laid eggs.

For these analytes, concentrations increased by 1 to 2%/d as nestlings grew, indicating that age should be considered when using nestling plasma to assess PFAS.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13.

However, it is difficult to isolate when competing bacteria or cold-damaged cells are present.        Objective: Herein, a medium (Campylobacter selective agar, CSA) was developed and supplemented with catalase, L-serine, L-cysteine, and quercetin for the selective detection of C. jejuni in food.        Method: The C. jejuni-detection efficiency in media broth and chicken tenders was evaluated. The pathogen was enumerated on modified charcoal-cefoperazone-deoxycholate agar (mCCDA), CSA supplemented with 4 mu M catalase (CSA-C4), 8 mu M catalase (CSA-C8), 20mM L-serine (CSA-S20) or 50mM L-serine (CSA-S50), and mCCDA supplemented with 0.5mM L-cysteine (mCCDA-LC0.5), 1mM L-cysteine (mCCDA-LC1), 40 mu M quercetin (mCCDA-Q40) or 320 mu M quercetin (mCCDA-Q320). The detection efficiency was then evaluated by counting colonies on the selective agar media. Quantitative assessment was also performed using chicken and duck carcasses.        Results: The C. jejuni detection efficiencies were higher (P < 0.05) in the groups CSA-C4 or CSA-C8, and CSA-S20 or CSA-S50, than mCCDA, and the detection efficiencies were maintained even in the presence of Acinetobacter baumannii, a competing bacterium. In the quantitative test, CSA-C8 and CSA-S50 demonstrated higher C. jejuni-detection efficiencies than mCCDA (control).        Conclusions: Therefore, CSA-C8 and CSA-S50 improved the detection efficiency of C. jejuni in poultry products by promoting the recovery of cold-damaged cells.        Highlights: When using CSA-C8 or CSA-S50 developed in this study for detection of C. jejuni in food, detection efficiency was higher than mCCDA.",NA,NA,NA

Fast sample preparation procedure was based on a sonication-assisted extraction with acetonitrile. Phospholipids in biological samples were fully removed by an off-line SPE purification before injection, using HybridSPE (R) Phospholipid Ultra cartridges.        The development of the on-line TFC clean-up procedure regarded the choice of the stationary phase, the optimization of the mobile phase composition, flow rate and injected volume.        The validation of the optimized method included the evaluation of matrix effects, accuracy and reproducibility. Signal suppression in the analysis of fortified extracts ranged from 1 to 60%, and this problem was overcome by using isotopic dilution. Since no certified reference materials were available for PFAS in these matrices, accuracy was evaluated by recoveries on spiked clam samples which were 98-133% for PFCAs and 40-60% for PFSAs. MLDs and MLQs ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 ng g(-1) wet weight and from 0.1 to 0.9 ng g(-1) wet weight respectively. Repeatability (intra-day precision) and reproducibility (inter-day precision) showed RSD from 3 to 13% and from 4 to 27% respectively. Validated on-line TFC/UHPLC-MS/MS method has been applied for the determination of perfluoroalkyl acids in different solid matrices (sediment, fish, bivalves and bird yolk). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using Western blot analysis, Bcl-XLONG was most frequently observed migrating as a doublet with a molecular mass of approximately 28 kDa; the apparent higher molecular mass band of this doublet was determined to represent a phosphorylated form. Consistent with previous findings reported for bcl-x messenger RNA, only the Bcl-XLONG (apoptosis-suppressing form of protein was detected in the hen granulosa cells, and highest levels of Bcl-XLONG protein (sum of the protein doublet) expression were found in granulosa from preovulatory follicles together with tissues with immune function (e.g. spleen and bone mallow). Evidence for Bcl-XSHORT expression was found only in the theca and several nonovarian tissues. Immunocytochemical analysis of preovulatory vs, prehierarchal follicles confirmed the comparatively greater expression of cytoplasmic Bcl-XLONG, particularly in preovulatory follicle granulosa. Levels of Bcl-XLONG were significantly increased after 20 h of culture in the presence of 8-bromo-cAMP (8-br-cAMP; compared with culture in control medium) in granulosa cells from both stages of follicle development. Such results are correlated with the protein's proposed function to protect against cell death in apoptosis-resistant, preovulatory follicle granulosa cells and are consistent with the ability of this cAMP agonist to increase bcl-XLONG messenger RNA levels in cultured cells. Furthermore, several factors that have previously been demonstrated to suppress apoptosis in granulosa cells, in vitro, (e.g. 8-br-cAMP, LH, FSH) were found to rapidly (within 15 min) increase levels of phosphorylated Bcl-XLONG, compared with control cells, whereas an inhibitor of protein kinase A (H-89) blocked such phosphorylation. By comparison, transforming growth factor a, a factor previously found to attenuate apoptosis and apoptosis-inducing agents (e.g. paclitaxel, C8-ceramide, daunorubicin, UV irradiation) failed to phosphorylate Bcl-XLONG. From these studies, it is concluded that both the phosphorylation of Bcl-XLONG (a short-term response) and increased levels of Bcl-XLONG (a comparatively stower response) in hen granulosa cells are promoted by gonadotropins via the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP signaling pathway. Moreover, elevated levels of chicken Bcl-XLONG protein expression and its phosphorylated state are correlated with resistance to apoptotic cell death in granulosa cells in vitro and ultimately a resistance to ovarian follicle atresia in vivo.",NA,NA,NA

Food producing animals such as chicken, beef, sheep and goats can take up soil while grazing or living outdoors (free-range) and this can result in contamination.        In recent decades, large quantities of brominated flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS) have been produced and released into the environment and this has resulted in widespread contamination of soils and other environmental matrices. These POPs also bioaccumulate and can contaminate food of animal origin resulting in indirect exposure of humans.        Recent assessments of chicken and beef have shown that surprisingly low concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in soil can result in exceedances of regulatory limits in food. Soil contamination limits have been established in a number of countries for PCDD/Fs but it has been shown that the contamination levels which result in regulatory limits in food (the maximum levels in the European Union) being exceeded, are below all the existing soil regulatory limits. 'Safe' soil levels are exceeded in many areas around emission sources of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. On the other hand, PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB levels in soil in rural areas, without a contamination source, are normally safe for food producing animals housed outdoors resulting in healthy food (e.g. meat, eggs, milk).        For the majority of POPs (e.g. PBDEs, PFOS, PFOA, SCCP) no regulatory limits in soils exist.        There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop appropriate and protective soil standards minimising human exposure from food producing animals housed outdoors. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to eliminate POPs pollution sources for soils and to control, secure and remediate contaminated sites and reservoirs, in order to reduce exposure and guarantee food safety.

We report here PFAA plasma concentrations in wild populations of great tits (Parus major) settled at and in the vicinity of a fluorochemical plant in Antwerp (Belgium). Using two generations we obtained novel results on some poorly known issues such as differences between sexes, maternal transfer of the compounds and potential associations with the oxidative status. For five out of the 11 detected PFAAs, the concentrations were the highest ever reported in birds' plasma, which confirms that Antwerp is one of the main hotspots for PFAAs pollution. Contrary to other studies conducted in birds, we found that females presented higher mean concentrations and detection frequencies for two compounds (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA)) than males. Maternal transfer and the dietary intake appear to be the main route of exposure for nestlings to PFOS but not to other compounds. Finally, PFAA concentrations tended to correlate positively with protein damage in adult birds while in nestlings they positively correlated with higher activity of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and catalase).

The study demonstrates that the LAESI-MS technique is a promising, rapid and accurate method for meat identification using a protocol combining principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).        METHODS: A focused IR-laser was used for meat sample ablation at a wavelength of 2940 nm. The ablated particulates were carried through a transfer PTFE tube using air as carrier gas, delivered to the electrospray plume and ionized. A TOF-MS was used to detect the ion signal. The raw mass spectra were analyzed using the PCA and PLS-DA protocol.        RESULTS: Five fresh meat samples, chicken, duck, pork, beef and mutton, were identified by the developed LAESI-MS technique using the protocol combining PCA and PLS-DA. The discrimination accuracy of all meat species is 100%, and the score plot also shows good identifying ability.        CONCLUSIONS: Five fresh meat samples were analyzed using the LAESI-MS technique. Each set of raw mass data was collected within 30s and analyzed by the PCA and PLS-DA protocol. Eighteen, 19, 18, 17, and 15 markers for chicken, duck, pork, beef, and mutton, respectively, have been selected successfully for meat identification.

PFOA is a known developmental toxicant that induces mortality in mammalian embryos and is thought to induce toxicity via interaction with the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). As the cardiovascular system is crucial for embryonic survival. PFOA-induced effects on the heart may partially explain embryonic mortality. To assess impacts of PFOA exposure on the developing heart in an avian model, we used histopathology and immunohistochemical staining for myosin to assess morphological alterations in 19-day-old chicken embryo hearts after PFOA exposure. Additionally, echocardiography and cardiac myofibril ATPase activity assays were used to assess functional alterations in 1-day-old hatchling chickens following developmental PFOA exposure. Overall thinning and thinning of a dense layer of myosin in the right ventricular wall were observed in PFOA-exposed chicken embryo hearts. Alteration of multiple cardiac structural and functional parameters, including left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular volume, heart rate, stroke volume, and ejection fraction were detected with echocardiography in the exposed hatchling chickens. Assessment of ATPase activity indicated that the ratio of cardiac myofibril calcium-independent ATPase activity to calcium-dependent ATPase activity was not affected, which suggests that developmental PFOA exposure may not affect cardiac energetics. In summary, structural and functional characteristics of the heart appear to be developmental targets of PFOA, possibly at the level of cardiomyocytes. Additional studies will investigate mechanisms of PFOA-induced developmental cardiotoxicity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

The 1941 egg contained hexachlorobenzene (HCB), but did not contain either of the pesticides hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) or p,p'-DDT, nor any metabolites of the latter. In contrast, the more recent eggs (REs) contained all of these compounds. Of the seven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) analyzed (CB28, -52, -101, -118, 138/-163, -153 and 180), only the more highly chlorinated congeners were detected in the 1941 sample, with CB153 followed by CB180 showing the highest concentrations. All eggs demonstrated the same congener pattern with respect to the more highly chlorinated PCBs, but concentrations were approximately 70-230 times higher in the REs. All of the polychlorinated-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran (PCDD/Fs) congeners analyzed were detected in the eggs, with the dominant congener being 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF (1250 pg/g l.w. in 1941 and 1540 pg/g l.w.

None of five congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) found in the REs was detected in the egg from 1941. The three methoxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs) analyzed were found at similar levels and with a similar congener pattern in REs as in the egg from 1941.        In conclusion, this study has shown the absence of DDE and PBDE and the presence of HCB and PCBs in a white-tailed sea eagle egg laid in 1941, and a strong increase of PCBs, DDE and PBDE in white-tailed sea eagle eggs from the same area in 1996-2001. The MeO-BDEs were found in similar concentrations in the analyzed eggs. The 1941 sample shows substantial concentrations of PCDD/Fs, noteworthy in the same magnitude as in the recent samples, illustrating the historical and recent exposure of these compounds.

CYP2 genes are highly diverse and orthologous relationships remain clouded among CYP2s in different taxa. Sequence and expression analyses of CYP2 genes in diapsids including birds and reptiles may improve understanding of this CYP family. We sought CYP2 genes in a liver cDNA library of the common cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), and in the genomes of other diapsids, chicken (Gallus gallus), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), for phylogenetic and/or syntenic analyses. Screening of the cDNA library yielded four CYP2 cDNA clones that were phylogenetically classified as CYP2C45, CYP2J25, CYP2AC1, and CYP2AF1. There are numerous newly identified diapsid CYP2 genes that include genes related to the human CYP2Cs, CYP2D6, CYP2G2P, CYP2J2, CYP2R1, CYP2U1, CYP2W1, CYP2AB1P, and CYP2AC1P. Syntenic relationships show that avian CYP2Hs are orthologous to CYP2C62P in humans. CYP2C23 in rats, and Cyp2c44 in mice, and suggest that avian CYP2Hs, along with human CYP2C62P and mouse Cyp2c44, could be renamed as CYP2C23, based upon the nomenclature rules. Analysis of sequence and synteny identifies cormorant and finch CYPs that are apparent orthologs of phenobarbital-inducible chicken CYP2C45. Transcripts of all four cormorant CYP2 genes were detected in the liver of birds from Lake Biwa, Japan. The transcript levels bore no significant relationship to levels of chlorinated organic pollutants in the liver, including polychlorinated biphenyls and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites. In contrast, concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorononanoic acid were negatively correlated with levels of CYP2C45 and/or CYP2J25, suggesting down-regulation of expression by these environmental pollutants. This study expands our view of the phylogeny and evolution of CYP2s, and provides evolutionary insight into the chemical regulation of CYP2 gene expression in diapsids including birds.

Around stage 18 of chick development, a mass of E/C8+ cells surrounds the postotic pharyngeal arches and forms a crescent-shaped arch, termed the circumpharyngeal ridge. Using immunohistochemistry and quail-chick chimeras, it was determined that the E/C8+ cell mass located in the circumpharyngeal ridge derives from the dorsolateral component of the cardiac neural crest. The ventrolateral cell population of the cardiac crest is located more medially and shows long-persistent HNK-1 immunoreactivity dorsolateral to the foregut. The crest cells that populate the gut arise from the caudal portion of the circumpharyngeal crest and are always located caudal to the caudal-most pharyngeal ectomesenchyme. Circumpharyngeal crest cells continuously populate the pharyngeal arch ectomesenchyme and enteric nervous system on the lateral side of the foregut wall, as well as the hypoglossal pathway which develops within the ventral portion of the circumpharyngeal ridge. E/C8 and HNK-1 immunoreactivity are associated with the cells migrating via the dorsolateral (circumpharyngeal) and ventrolateral pathways, respectively, with one exception: there is a population of putative crest cells along the proximal course of the vagal intestinal branch that shows both immunoreactivities around stage 20. DiI labeling of the cells in the circumpharyngeal ridge suggests that the cells are contributed from the circumpharyngeal ridge to this population. Thus, the distribution of the circumpharyngeal crest cells and their derivatives coincides with the peripheral branch distribution of the cranial nerves IX, X, and XII, whose development is selectively affected in the absence of the cardiac neural crest, the source of the circumpharyngeal crest.",NA,NA,NA

We show that model globular proteins (hen egg lysozyme, ribonuclease A, and insulin dimer) behave similarly with respect to adsorption. Experimentally, above a substrate wettability cos theta > 0,4 (where theta is the sessile contact angle of water on a substrate in air), the adsorbed mass, rigidity, and k(a) of the proteins are diminished, while the steric factor vertical bar A(1)vertical bar is increased, suggesting a lower packing density. To analyze these results, we have invoked computer simulations. We show that changing surface polarity has two profound effects. First, the amount adsorbed increases as the surfaces become more apolar. Further, the proteins become less stable as their adsorbed amount increased because they gain a large number of interprotein and protein-surface interactions. Finally, apolar surfaces served to reduce the unfolding free energy barriers, further facilitating the reorganizing of proteins on these surfaces. Thus, increasing the nonpolar nature of the surfaces resulted in a more rigid adsorbed layer, in good agreement with the experiments.",NA,NA,NA

The method has been evaluated in four different matrices (fish, pizza, chicken nuggets and spinach). Originally, the focus was to develop a method for foods commonly thought to be a source of PFASs (e.g. fish). It was expanded to include foods where PFAS exposure would be possible through their presence in grease-proof food packaging (e.g. pizza, chicken nuggets). Vegetables (lettuce) and fruit (tomato) have recently been considered as part of proficiency testing programmes, so the inclusion of some testing in a vegetable matrix (i.e. spinach) was also added to the testing. Limits of quantification ranged from 0.018 ng g(-1) (L-PFDS) to 5.28 ng g(-1) (FHEA), although method quantification limits for PFBA (12.4 ng g(-1)), 6:2 PAP (8.96 ng g(-1)) and 8:2 PAP (3.49 ng g(-1)) were elevated above instrumental limits owing to their consistent detection in reagent blank samples. PFAS analyses were strongly impacted by matrix, therefore the use of isotopically labelled internal standards was critical to the development of accurate results. The accuracy of the method using numerous proficiency testing schemes or interlaboratory comparison studies has shown the developed method to be successful with z-scores for all concerned analytes in all test matrices remaining within +/- 2.0, with the exception of PFBA in wheat flour which was -2.4.",NA,NA,NA

The complement components involved in MAC formation are C5b, C6, C7, C8 alpha, C8 beta, C8 gamma and C9. Among them, C6 protein interacts with C5b through a metastable binding site to form a soluble C5b-6 dimer in the vicinity of the activating cell. Formation of the MAC is controlled by complement regulatory molecules, such as CD59, vitronectin and clusterin. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the C6 complement component, as well as the spatial and temporal expression profile of MAC structural (C6, C7, C8 alpha, C8 beta, C8 gamma) and regulatory (CID59, vitronectin and clusterin) genes in chicken (Gallus gallus). The deduced polypeptide sequence of chicken C6 consists of 935 amino acid residues and exhibits 81%, 58%, 56% and 44% identity with zebra finch, human, frog and trout orthologs, respectively. The 'domain' architecture of chicken C6 resembles that of mammalian counterparts and the cysteine backbone is also conserved. MAC structural and regulatory genes are expressed in a wide range of adult chicken tissues, with the liver being the major source of their produced transcripts. The developmental expression profile of chicken MAC structural genes shows that their transcripts initially appear in the 12th embryonic day in the liver, exhibiting a pick in the 17th, while no expression was detected in the early whole embryo (day 4 and 6), as well as in the 2-day old neonate chicken liver.

This suggests toxicological studies based on T-PFOS data may inaccurately assess exposure risk to wildlife. To determine whether PFOS effects were influenced by isomer content, we compared the transcriptional profiles of cultured chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEH) exposed to either L-PFOS or T-PFOS using Agilent microarrays. At equal concentrations (10 mu M), T-PFOS altered the expression of more transcripts (340, >1.5-fold change, p<0.05) compared with L-PFOS (130 transcripts). Higher concentrations of L-PFOS (40 mu M) were also less transcriptionally disruptive (217 transcripts) than T-PFOS at 10 mu M. Functional analysis showed that L-PFOS and T-PFOS affected genes involved in lipid metabolism, hepatic system development, and cellular growth and proliferation. Pathway and interactome analysis suggested that genes may be affected through the RXR receptor, oxidative stress response, TP53 signaling, MYC signaling, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and PPAR gamma and SREBP receptors. In all functional categories and pathways examined, the response elicited by T-PFOS was greater than that of L-PFOS. These data show that T-PFOS elicits a greater transcriptional response in CEH than L-PFOS alone and demonstrates the importance of considering the isomer-specific toxicological properties of PFOS when assessing exposure risk.

Results from a variety of transformed or continuous mammalian cell lines suggest that, due to the combination of these features, Survivin is capable of regulating both cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. However, to date there is essentially no information regarding Survivin expression, regulation or function within the ovary, or in any nonmammalian vertebrate species. In the present studies, cDNAs for chicken (ch) Survivin-142 (homologous to human Survivin-142) plus three alternatively spliced variants (ch Survivin-short, -gamma, and -delta) are described, and of these, transcripts for ch Survivin-142 and -short are expressed in granulosa cells from the hen ovary. Highest levels of Survivin mRNA during follicle development occur in mitotically active granulosa cells from undifferentiated, prehierarchal follicles. Cell cycle analysis determined that Survivin mRNA expression is elevated specifically during the G2/M phase of mitosis. Significantly, transient transfection with ch Survivin-142 in primary cultures of hen granulosa cells attenuates taxol- and N-octanoylsphingosine- (C8-ceramide-) induced caspase-3 activity, whereas overexpression of ch Survivin-short (a truncated variant that lacks much of the functional BIR domain plus the entire alpha-helix coil domain) lacks this antiapoptotic activity.

Bird eggs have several advantages than other environmental matrixes, which have been used extensively to portray the accumulation and distribution of OCPs. The present study investigated the organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues in eggs of 22 species of terrestrial birds collected from Tamil Nadu, India. Eggs found abandoned were collected during nest monitoring between 2001 and 2008 and analyzed for the presence of organochlorine pesticide residues. The results showed that the mean concentrations of total hexachlorohexane ( n-ary sumation HCHs), total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( n-ary sumation DDTs), heptachlor epoxide, and dieldrin ranged from non-detectable (nd) to 2800 ng/g, nd to1000 ng/g, nd to 700 ng/g, and nd to 240 ng/g on a wet mass (wm) basis, respectively. The variation in magnitude of contamination among the species and feeding guilds were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Among the OCPs analyzed, the residues of beta-HCH andp,p '-DDE were found to be the abundant in concentration. Similarly, among various bird species studied, the highest concentrations of n-ary sumation OCPs (> 5000 ng/g wm) were recorded in the eggs of gray junglefowl, scaly-breasted munia, and red-whiskered bulbul. This may be due to their widespread occurrence of their habitat at proximity to the agricultural fields, where organochlorines were in use until recently. Among the various contaminants analyzed, concentrations ofp,p '-DDE and heptachlor epoxide exceeded the threshold levels of toxicity for wild birds in > 5% of the egg samples. Hence, this study indicates the need for continued monitoring and further systematic ecotoxicological investigation of these compounds not only in eggs but also in other environmental media.",NA,NA,NA

Long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) blubber and meat are known sources of environmental exposure. The present study focus on the organohalogen contamination of the fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis). The compounds quantified in fulmar muscle, fat, and egg are PCBs, DDTs, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The dominating pollutants are the 4,4'-DDT metabolite 4,4'-DDE and the two PCB congeners, CB-153 and CB-180, which are present in geometric mean concentrations of 7100, 4700 and 2500 ng/g lipid weight (l.w.), respectively, in adult fulmar muscle. 4,4-DDT and HCB concentrations are approximately 250 ng/g l.w., each. Concentrations in the eggs are about 50% of the fulmar muscle levels, due to differences in lipid amounts, 4% in muscle and 10% in the eggs, the exposure contribution on a fresh weight basis is almost the same. As a result, both the egg and the adult fulmar muscle may lead to a significant exposure risk, if consumed by humans.        BDE-153, the most abundant PBDE congener in fulmar muscle, with a geometric mean concentration of 6.5 ng/g l.w., is much lower than the individual PCB congeners and 4,4'-DDE concentrations. In the adult fulmar muscle, the relative PBDE congener pattern is different from that previously observed in biota, with BDE-153 and BDE-154 as the dominating congeners, rather than BDE-47. In contrast, BDE-47 is the most abundant congener in juvenile muscle and subcutaneous fat. The EPBDE concentrations are almost the same in egg, muscle (adult and juvenile) and subcutaneous fat (juvenile). For the polybrominated biphenyl (BB-153) the concentrations are considerably higher in the adult bird and egg than in the juvenile bird; this is also seen for the PCB and 4,4'-DDE concentrations.        PCB concentrations found in fulmar egg and muscle are in the same range as seen in the pilot whale, i.e. 590-5700 ng/g l.w. for CB-153. Hence humans are also exposed to PCBs at a reasonable degree via intake of fulmar and/or fulmar egg and not only via pilot whale blubber. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Once optimised, the procedure allowed sample preparation to be accomplished within 30 min, in a single step, and with minimal sample and reagent consumption and waste generation. These features contributed to speeding up and greening the analytical process as compared to the large-scale multistep procedures for these types of analyses. The method was combined with gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-qMS) for PCB and OCP analysis and with GC-negative ion chemical ionisation-quadrupole mass spectrometry (NCI-qMS) for PBDE and DP determination. The complete analytical method provided satisfactory recoveries of the target compounds (above 83% for all analytes, except for PBDE 209, 63%), although as small an amount of sample as 0.300 g was used. The repeatability of the complete procedure was less than 16%(with the only exception for PCB 153, which looked to be affected by an interference). The limits of detection were in all cases lower than 34 pg g(-1) dry weight (as calculated for real samples), demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed procedure for accurate determination of the target compounds in biological samples.

Here, we employed a simple messenger RNA (mRNA) screening method using quantitative PCR to assess the effects of PFCs on mRNA expression in chicken embryo hepatocytes (CEH). CEH cultures were treated with perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates of varying chain lengths and linear or technical grade potassium perfluoro-1-octane sulfonate (L-PFOS and T-PFOS). T-PFOS comprised 80% perfluorooctane sulfonate isomers (62% linear) and various PFCs and inorganic salts.

Compared to L-PFOS, T-PFOS altered the mRNA expression level of more genes and produced greater fold changes. L-FABP was upregulated by PFCs greater than or equal to eight carbons, while CYPs were upregulated by PFCs less than or equal to eight carbons.

This paper reviews available data on methoxylated polybrominated Biphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs), heptachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrok (Q1) and 1,1'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyrroles (HDBPs) in these animals. In all, 25 papers reported such HNPs in seabirds. White tailed sea eagle from Sweden was the seabird species with higher MeO-BDEs levels in eggs and blood, while in liver the European shag from Norway was the one. Regarding HDBPs, glaucous gull livers from North Water Polynya and Leach's storm petrel eggs from South Canada (NE Atlantic) showed the highest levels, while brown skua eggs presented the highest concentration of Q1. DBPBr4Cl2 and DBP-Br-6 were the most abundant HDBPs in seabirds, although only one study investigated DBP-Br-6. Furthermore, 2'-MeO-BDE-68/6'-MeO-BDE-47 ratios were lower than one in mostly of the studies (91%). The main sources of methoxylated congeners found in seabirds might to be from sponges and/or associated organisms (bacteria). The scarcity of data in seabirds showed the gap in knowledge. Few studies were done especially in tropical areas and Southern Hemisphere and the most were conducted in the northwest part of the globe. This review arouses the need of knowledge about the distribution of these compounds in seabirds worldwide as well as it encourages toxicological studies to better understand the possible effects of HNPs on seabirds.

The present study characterized a novel member of fosA gene located on a plasmid from Escherichia coli.        Materials and Methods: A fosfomycin-resistant E. coli isolate PK9 was recovered from a chicken meat sample in 2018. The presence of fosA genes was detected by PCR and sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), conjugation, and cloning were performed to identify the mechanism responsible for fosfomycin resistance. Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing was carried out to characterize the plasmid carrying fosfomycin resistance gene and the genetic context of the novel fosA variant.        Results: A novel fosA gene with significant homology (>98%) with fosA6 and fosA5 genes was identified by WGS and was named fosA10. FosA10 shared 56.1% to 98.6% amino acid sequence identity with other reported plasmid-mediated FosA enzymes. Fosfomycin resistance and fosA10 gene were successfully transferred to E. coli C600 by conjugation. Cloning confirmed that FosA10 could confer fosfomycin resistance (MIC > 128 mu g/mL). The fosA10 gene was localized on a 53kb IncFII (F35:A-:B-) plasmid. The Delta lysR-fosA10-Delta hp fragment (4328 bp), located between two copies of IS10R, showed 100% identity with the chromosomal sequences of 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains of ST664 and one of ST3821 in GenBank.        Conclusion: Our findings indicated that the fosA10 gene of E. coli might be captured from the chromosome of K. pneumoniae by IS10, which further demonstrated that K. pneumoniae might act as a reservoir of fosA-like genes acquired by E. coli.","Cited By :8

Bird eggs have several advantages compared to other environmental media which have previously been used to map the distribution of OHPs. In this study, large-scale geographical variation in the occurrence of OHPs, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), was investigated throughout Europe using eggs of a terrestrial residential passerine species, the great tit (Parus major). Great tit eggs from 22 sampling sites, involving urban, rural and remote areas, in 14 European countries were collected and analysed (5-8 eggs per sampling site). The environmentally most important congeners/compounds of the analysed pollutants were detectable in all sampling locations. For PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs, no clear geographical contamination pattern was found. Sum PCB levels ranged from 143 ng/g lipid weight (lw) to 3660 ng/g lw. As expected, PCB concentrations were significantly higher in the sampled urban compared to the remote locations. However, the urban locations did not show significantly higher concentrations compared to the rural locations. Sum PBDEs ranged from 4.0 ng/g lw to 136 ng/g lw. PBDEs were significantly higher in the urbanized sampling locations compared to the other locations. The significant, positive correlation between PCB and PBDE concentrations suggests similar spatial exposure and/or mechanisms of accumulation. Significantly higher levels of OCPs (sum OCPs ranging from 191 ng/g lw to 7830 ng/g lw) were detected in rural sampling locations. Contamination profiles of PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs differed also among the sampling locations, which may be due to local usage and contamination sources. The higher variance among sampling locations for the PCBs and OCPs, suggests that local contamination sources are more important for the PCBs and OCPs compared to the PBDEs. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which bird eggs were used as a monitoring tool for CHPs on such a large geographical scale. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

The best fitting for both species was provided by a simple pseudo monocompartmental first-order kinetics model, regulated by two rates, and accounting for real elimination as well as binding of PFOS to non-exchangeable structures. Elimination was more rapid in rabbits, with a pseudo first-order dissipation half-life of 88 days compared to the 230 days observed for chickens. By contrast, the calculated assimilation efficiency for rabbits was almost 1, very close to full absorption, significantly higher than the 0.66 with confidence intervals of 0.64 and 0.68 observed for chickens. The results confirm a very different kinetics than that observed in single-dose experiments confirming clear dose-related differences in apparent elimination rates in rabbits, as previously described for humans and other mammals; suggesting the role of a capacity-limited saturable process resulting in different kinetic behaviours for PFOS in high dose versus environmentally relevant low dose exposure conditions. The model calculations confirmed that the measured maximum concentrations were still far from the steady state situation, and that the different kinetics between birds and mammals should may play a significant role in the biomagnifications assessment and potential exposure for humans and predators. For the same dose regime, the steady state concentration was estimated at about 36 mu g PFOS/L serum for rabbits, slightly above one-half of the 65 mu g PFOS/L serum estimated for chickens. The toxicokinetic parameters presented here can be used for higher-tier bioaccumulation estimations of PFOS in rabbits and chickens as starting point for human health exposure assessments and as surrogate values for modeling PFOS kinetics in wild mammals and bird in exposure assessment of predatory species.

In animals these compounds are known to accumulate in livers. In order to determine potential PFASs contamination in commercially available livers, samples from farmed sheep, horses, cows, pigs and chicken were collected from the Dutch market. PFOS was the only detectable PFAS and its concentration was higher in free ranging animals like cows and sheep. The detected levels of PFOS in the liver samples were very low (up to 4.5 ng g(-1) ww).        To further study the kinetic behaviour in foraging animals, samples from a study in which sheep were fed with grass obtained from a river floodplain, were examined. PFOS was the only detectable PFAS in the contaminated grass pellets, showing a level of about 0.5 mu g kg(-1). Young blackhead sheep were fed with either clean or contaminated grass for a period up to 112 days. A time-dependent increase in liver PFOS concentrations was observed from 2.4 to 10.9 ng g(-1) ww after 8 and 112 days respectively. A time-dependent depuration was observed in livers of animals switched to clean grass after 56 days of exposure, from 9.2 to 4.7 ng g(-1) ww after 64 and 112 days respectively. The percentage of PFOS ingested from the grass and retained in the liver was estimated to be 12% at day 56, and decreased gradually to 6% after 56 days on clean grass, showing that the decrease in levels is not only caused by an increase in liver weight.        Levels detected in commercial livers but also those in the sheep study would not lead to exceedance of the current TDI for PFOS set by EFSA. Therefore, it can be assumed that they do not present a risk for human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

However, little is known on the intrinsic molecular mechanism via which the growth performance of birds improves. This study was therefore performed to investigate the expression profiles of genes induced by roxarsone. Fifty-six broiler chickens were divided into two groups, namely treated and untreated with roxarsone. The treated group was provided a diet of 45.4 mg/kg roxarsone medication and the other group acted as control. Data analysis showed that roxarsone consistently and significantly (P<0.05) increased chicken growth performance. In addition to this a significant (P<0.05) increase of arsenic residue in liver has been seen. Microarray expression analysis of 8935 genes in liver showed that 22 genes (10 up- and 12 down-regulated) had altered expression throughout the experimental periods. Two novel genes (GenBank accession no. GU724343 and GU724344) were cloned through rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Gene GU724343 was predicted to encode an unidentified protein and the second gene GU724344 was presumed to encode a new member of immunoglobulin-like receptor (CHIR) family. Our results suggested for the first time that the role of roxarsone could be mainly to modify the expression levels of cell growth, immunity/defense and energy metabolism associated genes, as a result promoting animal growth. Further research on these genes should help to increase the knowledge of improving animal productivity safely and effectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

We used solar geolocation loggers and stable isotope analysis to study the effects of post breeding dispersal and diet on persistent organic pollutant (POP) and mercury (Hg) burdens in rhinoceros auklets, Cerorhinca monocerata, breeding on islands along the Pacific Coast of Canada. Hg and four classes of POPs were measured in auklet eggs: organochlorine insecticides (OCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and perfluoralkyl substances (PFASs). Stable isotope values of adult breast feathers grown during winter were used in conjunction with geolocation to elucidate adult wintering latitude. Wintering latitude was the most consistent and significant predictor of some POP and of Hg concentrations in eggs. The magnitude and pattern of exposure varied by contaminant, with PPCBs, PPBDEs and DDE decreasing with wintering latitude, and mirex, perfluoro-n-tridecanoic acid, and Hg increasing with latitude. We suggest that concentrations of these contaminants in rhinoceros auklet eggs are influenced by variation in uptake at adult wintering locations related to anthropogenic inputs and oceanic and atmospheric transport.

Evidence regarding neurodevelopmental effects of PFAS have been mixed. The relation between PFAS exposure and anatomical markers that have been suggested to correlate with fetal brain development have not been studied.        OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between prenatal PFAS exposures and three craniofacial features in children measured at 5 years of age.        METHODS: Measures of palpebral fissure length (PFL), philtrum groove, and upper-lip thickness were generated from standardized digital facial photographs from 656 children in the Danish National Birth Cohort. PFL was classified into two groups (shorter; normal), and the philtrum (grooved; smooth; normal) and upper-lip (thick; thin; normal) measures into three groups each. Six PFAS were measured in maternal plasma (median= 8 gestational wk). Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each facial feature using the normal group as the reference according to log2-PFAS concentration (in nanograms per milliliter) or PFAS tertiles, adjusting for potential confounders, including maternal alcohol intake and smoking. Stratified analyses by maternal alcohol intake or child's sex were performed.        RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to each PFAS was associated with elevated odds for a shorter PFL, with the strongest association observed for perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA; per doubling OR = 2:02; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.70). Some nonlinear associations were found for philtrum measures: the second tertile of PFDA and perfluorononanoic acid were associated with grooved philtrum, whereas the second tertile of perfluoroheptane sulfonate with smooth philtrum. The associations between PFAS exposure and a shorter PFL were stronger among mothers who consumed alcohol in the first trimester, some sex-specific associations were noted for philtrum and upper-lip measures.        DISCUSSION: Prenatal PFAS exposures might influence fetal craniofacial development. A larger study is needed to replicate the potential modifying effects observed for alcohol exposure and to clarify whether associations of craniofacial markers observed reflect specific neurologic deficits.",NA,NA,NA

To explore the potential mechanism of developmental cardiotoxicity induced by PFOA exposure, chicken embryo primary cardiomyocytes were extracted either from chicken embryos pretreated with PFOA (2 mg/kg), or from untreated embryos and then directly exposed cells to PFOA (1, 10, 30 or 100 mu g/ml) in culture. Additionally, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) silencing lentivirus was applied to the embryos on embryonic day (ED2). Cell viability was measured with CCK-8 kit, morphology was assessed with hematoxylin and eosin staining, and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were determined with Fluo-4 AM probe. Western blotting was utilized to confirm PPAR alpha silencing efficiency and the protein abundance of Wnt5a and Frizzled2. The results indicated that both PFOA pretreatment and direct exposure decreased primary cardiomyocyte viability, altered cell morphology and increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. While L-carnitine co-treatment effectively abolished such changes, PPAR alpha silencing only abolished most of the changes in PFOA pretreatment group, but not in cells directly exposed to relatively high doses of PFOA. The protein abundance of Wnt5a and Frizzled2 was increased by PFOA pretreatment, while direct exposure to PFOA increased Frizzled2 abundance but decreased Wnt5a abundance. PPAR alpha silencing resulted in over 50% decrease of PPAR alpha expression level, which abolished the Wnt5a/Frizzled2 expression alterations following PFOA exposure. In conclusion, PFOA-induced primary cardiomyocyte toxicity is associated with PPAR alpha and Wnt5a/Frizzled2, in which PPAR alpha seems to play regulatory roles towards Wnt5a/Frizzled2.",NA,NA,NA

The intensity of the reflected light beam depends on the presence of a liquid film on the surface. This allows to estimate the movement of the liquid film along the sorbent surface. Thus, the extended DTM can be used for determining the wettability of optically nontransparent solid plates. The adsorption behavior of four proteins (albumin, lysozyme, beta-lactoglobulin, ovalbumin) on a hydrophobic hydroxyapatite plate in water was studied by this method. When adsorbed from a protein solution of high concentration, the surfaces of adsorbed proteins, except ovalbumin, were fairly hydrophilic; this hydrophilicity was already attained at the initial stage of the adsorption process. The surface of ovalbumin on hydroxyapatite was more hydrophobic than those of the other proteins, and the hydrophilicity increased with the protein adsorption process. At low protein concentration, the hydrophilicity increased in the course of the adsorption process. The change in hydrophilicity with time depends on the kind of protein. Hen's egg lysozyme is more hydrophilic and the time to reach saturation is shorter than for the other proteins. The processes of increasing hydrophilicity of the surface of human serum albumin, beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin are similar. However, for beta-lactoglobulin hydrophobicity at adsorption saturation is stronger than for human serum albumin and ovalbumin. Thus, using DTM it is shown that the hydrophilicity of the surface of adsorbed protein on hydroxyapatite depends strongly on the kind of protein.",NA,NA,NA

We collected dipper prey and eggs from relatively pristine British Columbian rivers contrasting in the presence of salmon-derived nutrients, and rural Welsh rivers with varying food-web complexity associated with stream acidity. Enriched delta C-13 and to a lesser extent delta N-15 in American dipper eggs and prey confirmed that streams with migrating Pacific salmon were enriched with marine-derived nutrients, but overall contaminant concentrations did not differ strongly in dipper eggs between rivers with and without salmon. However dipper contaminant profiles, particularly PBDEs, mercury and Sigma DDTs, were related to delta C-13, reflecting the marine influence and greater fish consumption at salmon sites. Irrespective of catchment influences and despite feeding at a higher trophic level, American dipper eggs (n = 17) contained lower levels of organohalogens than Eurasian dippers (n = 37), but with similar PCB (153 and 138) and PBDE (47 and 99) congeners dominanating. Eurasian dipper eggs from circumneutral streams contained more dieldrin, Sigma DDT and Sigma hexachlorocyclohexanes while Sigma chlordanes, mirex, Sigma PBDEs and Sigma PCBs predominated at acid sites.

Their persistent nature and potential health impacts are of concern. Given the high cost of collecting serum samples, this study is to understand whether we can quantify PFC serum concentrations using factors extracted from questionnaire responses and indirect measurements, and whether a single serum measurement can be used to classify an individual's exposure over a one-year period. The study population included three demographic groups: young children (2-8 years old) (N=67), parents of young children (< 55 years old) (N=90), and older adults ( > 55 years old) (N=59). PFC serum concentrations, house dust concentrations, and questionnaires were collected. The geometric mean of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was highest for the older adults. In contrast, the geometric mean of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was highest for children. Serum concentrations of the parent and the child from the same family were moderately correlated (Spearman correlation (r)=0.26-0.79, p <0.05), indicating common sources within a family. For adults, age, having occupational exposure or having used fire extinguisher, frequencies of consuming butter/margarine, pork, canned meat entres, tuna and white fish, freshwater fish, and whether they ate microwave popcorn were significantly positively associated with serum concentrations of individual PFCs. For children, residential dust concentrations, frequency of wearing waterproof clothes, frequency of having canned fish, hotdogs, chicken nuggets, French fries, and chips, and whether they ate microwave popcorn were significant positive predictors of individual PFC serum concentrations. In addition, the serum concentrations collected in a subset of young children (N=20) and the parents (N=42) one year later were strongly correlated (r=0.68-0.98, p <0.001) with the levels measured at the first visits, but showed a decreasing trend. Children had moderate correlation (r=0.43) between serum and dust concentrations. of PFOS, indicating indoor sources contribute to exposure. In conclusion, besides food intake, occupational exposure, consumer product use, and exposure to residential dust contribute to PFC exposure. The downward temporal trend of serum concentrations reflects the reduction of PFCs use in recent years while the year-to-year correlation indicates that a single serum measurement could be an estimate of exposure relative to the population for a one-year period in epidemiology studies.

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily by gavage from gestation day (GD) 2 to GD 21; pregnant CD-1 mice were treated with 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg PFOS from GD 1 to GD 18. Controls received 0.5% Tween-20 vehicle (1 ml/kg for rats and 10 ml/kg for mice). At parturition, newborns were observed for clinical signs and survival. All animals were born alive and initially appeared to be active. In the highest dosage groups (10 mg/kg for rat and 20 mg/kg for mouse), the neonates became pale, inactive, and moribund within 30-60 min, and all died soon afterward. In the 5 mg/kg (rat) and 15 mg/kg (mouse) dosage groups, the neonates also became moribund but survived for a longer period of time (8-12 h). Over 95% of these animals died within 24 h. Approximately 50% of offspring died at 3 mg/kg for rat and 10 mg/kg for mouse. Cross-fostering the PFOS-exposed rat neonates (5 mg/kg) to control nursing dams failed to improve survival. Serum concentrations of PFOS in newborn rats mirrored the maternal administered dosage and were similar to those in the maternal circulation at GD 21; PFOS levels in the surviving neonates declined in the ensuing days. Small but significant and persistent growth lags were detected in surviving rat and mouse pups exposed to PFOS prenatally, and slight delays in eye opening were noted. Significant increases in liver weight were observed in the PFOS-exposed mouse pups. Serum thyroxine levels were suppressed in the PFOS-treated rat pups, although triiodothyronine and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] levels were not altered. Choline acetyltransferase activity (an enzyme that is sensitive to thyroid status) in the prefrontal cortex of rat pups exposed to PFOS prenatally was slightly reduced, but activity in the hippocampus was not affected. Development of learning, determined by T-maze delayed alternation in weanling rats, was not affected by PFOS exposure. These results indicate that in utero exposure to PFOS severely compromised postnatal survival of neonatal rats and mice, and caused delays in growth and development that were accompanied by hypothyroxinemia in the surviving rat pups.",NA,NA,NA

Despite frequent and relatively high concentrations of OCs in eaglets, little is understood about potential biological effects associated with exposure. We screened an existing database of OC concentrations in eaglet plasma collected from the Midwestern United States against bioactivity information from the ToxCast database. ToxCast bioactivity information consists of concentrations expected to elicit responses across a range of biological space (e.g. cellular, developmental, etc.) obtained from a series of high throughput assays. We calculated exposure-activity ratios (EAR) by calculating the ratio of plasma concentrations to concentrations available in ToxCast. Bioactivity data were not available for all detected OCs. Therefore, our analysis provides estimates of potential bioactivity for 19 of the detected OCs in eaglet plasma. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) EAR values were consistently the highest among all study areas. Maximum EAR values were >= 1 for PFOS, perfiuorononanoic acid, and bisphenol A in 99.7, 0.53 and 0.26% of samples, indicating that some plasma concentrations were greater than what may be expected to elicit biological responses. About 125 gene targets, indicative of specific biological pathways, were identified as potentially being affected. Inhibition of several CYP genes, involved in xenobiotic metabolism, were most consistently identified. Other identified biological responses have potential implications for motor coordination, cardiac functions, behavior, and blood circulation. However, it is unclear what these results mean for bald eagles, given that ToxCast data are generated using mammalian-based endpoints. Despite uncertainties and limitations, this method of screening environmental data can be useful for informing future monitoring or research focused on understanding the occurrence and effects of OCs in bald eagles and other similarly-positioned trophic species.

Nevertheless, this application will lead to the contamination of the environment as well as animal products. Understanding the response of genes to roxarsone may bring about the discovery of new, safer substitutes. In this study, we monitored the expression of 8,935 genes in chicken breast muscle using microarrays. Analysis showed that 30 genes, such as the interleukin 3 regulated nuclear factor (NFIL3), the regulatory factor X-associated ankyrin-containing protein (RFXANK), the cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 3 (CPSF3), and the FK506 binding protein 9 (FKBP9), have consistently up or downregulated (fold change >= 1.5 or <= 0.6, P < 0.05, false discovery rate <= 0.05) throughout the medication periods. The results from microarray analysis were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Further functional investigation showed that 13 of the identified genes are well documented, and surprisingly, 11 (85%) of these are related to immunity (5 are immunity and defense related, 4 are immunodeficiency disease related, 2 are immunosuppressive drug related), and the remaining 2 are energy metabolism related. These findings may suggest that supplement of roxarsone can improve the immunity of chickens through regulating the expression of associated genes, and as a result contribute to the growth promotion. Further research on the encoded proteins of the differentially expressed genes should provide more evidence for the potential mechanism.",NA,NA,NA

They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring 'legacy contaminants' in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors fromEurope reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasmawere the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solventextraction is the preferred choice.

Levels of p,p'-DDE were found to be higher than in eggs laid by other European owls in the same decade, probably due to the greater agricultural activity in our study area. Compared to other European raptors, exposure to PCBs can be considered intermediate, but low to PBDEs. Land use differences and prey availability were the rationale to divide the study area in two subareas in further assessments. Temporal trends of HCB, p.p'-DDE, beta-HCH, PCBs and PBDEs were significantly different in each subarea, generally increasing over time in the Southern but decreasing or remaining stable in the Northern. On the contrary, levels of cyclodienes tended to decrease in both subareas. Dietary shifts with a greater amount of birds are suggested as a cause for increasing organochlorine loads in raptors. This may explain the increasing trend in the Southern territories. However, due to the proximity of most of these nests to Cartagena, an important industrial city, increasing environmental pollution cannot be ruled out. Although average levels of the compounds analysed are below threshold levels, 17% of the samples exceeded 400 pg g(-1) ww (wet weight), the LOAEC for Total TEQs. Moreover, a negative correlation between TEQ concentrations and the metabolizable fraction of PCBs (F-prob = 0.0018) was found when TEQs values were above 10 pg g(-1) ww. This could be indicative of hepatic enzymes induction in the birds exposed at higher concentrations, which are mainly breeding in the Southern subarea. These females could be suffering from Ah-receptor-related toxic effects, some of which have been related to altered bird reproduction. Finally, a significant negative correlation between p, p'-DDE levels and eggshell thickness (r = -0.469, p < 0.001) was observed, with about 17% of eggshell thinning for eggs with p.p'-DDE levels above 100 mu g g(-1) lw. The persistence of this degree of thinning over a period of time has been related to population declines in other raptor species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

In vivo as well as in vitro experiments showed that ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH) clearly increases thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in late embryonic and early posthatch chicks. In vivo experiments in older chickens, however, suggested that this response might disappear at a later stage. Therefore we started to study in detail the ontogeny of the TSH releasing activity of oCRH using the in vitro perifusion technique. Several embryonic stages (E14, E16, and E18) as well as posthatch stages (C1, C8, C22, and adult chickens) were included in the study. We also investigated the possible regulatory role of somatostatin (SRIH) in this specific endocrine function of CRH. The perifusion studies show that CRH stimulated the TSH release at all stages tested. The 10 and 100 nM oCRH doses were almost equally effective at the early embryonic stages while in most posthatch stages the higher oCRH dose was significantly more effective than the lower one. The stimulation factor, representative for the relative increase in TSH secretion following oCRH challenge, was high at early embryonic stages and clearly lower in adult animals. This seemed to be related to an age-dependent increase in basal TSH secretion levels. In both embryonic (E19) and posthatch (C8) chicks a pretreatment of the pituitaries with SRIH lowered the sensitivity of the thyrotropes to an oCRH challenge. This effect was more pronounced in the posthatch chicks compared to the embryos. The results show that CRH is capable of stimulating the TSH secretion during the entire life cycle of the chicken and that SRIH may play an important role in the fine-tuning of this response by lowering the sensitivity of the thyrotropes to CRH.

Spiked serums at four concentrations (0, 0.5, 5.0 and 25 ng mL(-1)) were prepared by protein precipitation (PPT), enhanced matrix removal (EMR), weak anion exchange (WAX), and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) solid-phase extraction cartridges. The extract from each methodology was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), and concentrations were compared with known concentrations in the spiked media. EMR performed the best overall, with 40 of 53 compounds effectively recovered at 5 ng mL(-1). Furthermore, EMR was effective overall at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 25 ng mL(-1) for 39 out of 53. Similarly, PPT was effective for 35 of 53 compounds at all spiked serum concentrations. There was a negative correlation between internal standard recovery for compounds with increasing octanol-water coefficients (K-ow) for WAX (R = - 0.65, p = 0.0043) and HLB (R = - 0.62, p = 0.0077) extractions, indicating methanol may not be a suitable solvent for long-chain PFAS extraction from protein-rich tissues.

PFOS is an environmentally persistent compound used as a surfactant and occurs as a degradation product of both perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride and substituted perfluorooctane sulfonamido components found in many commercial and consumer applications. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily by gavage from gestational day (GD) 2 to GD 20; CD-1 mice were similarly treated with 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg PFOS from GD 1 to GD 17. Controls received 0.5% Tween-20 vehicle (1 ml/kg for rats and 10 ml/kg for mice). Maternal weight gain, food and water consumption, and serum chemistry were monitored. Rats were euthanized on GD 21 and mice on GD 18. PFOS levels in maternal serum and in maternal and fetal livers were determined. Maternal weight gains in both species were suppressed by PFOS in a dose-dependent manner, likely attributed to reduced food and water intake. Serum PFOS levels increased with dosage, and liver levels were approximately fourfold higher than serum. Serum thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3) in the PFOS-treated rat dams were significantly reduced as early as one week after chemical exposure, although no feedback response of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed. A similar pattern of reduction in T-4 was also seen in the pregnant mice. Maternal serum triglycerides were significantly reduced, particularly in the high-dose groups, although cholesterol levels were not affected. In the mouse dams, PFOS produced a marked enlargement of the liver at 10 mg/kg and higher dosages. In the rat fetuses, PFOS was detected in the liver but at levels nearly half of those in the maternal counterparts, regardless of administered doses. In both rodent species, PFOS did not alter the numbers of implantations or live fetuses at term, although small deficits in fetal weight were noted in the rat. A host of birth defects, including cleft palate, anasarca, ventricular septal defect, and enlargement of the right atrium, were seen in both rats and mice, primarily in the 10 and 20 mg/kg dosage groups, respectively.

However, microplastic pollution has not been frequently studied in the oligotrophic oceanic regions around the Xisha Islands, the largest marine coral reef area of China. In this study, microplastics in surface seawater were sampled from 30 stations in the region around the Xisha Islands. Marine microplastics were classified via a microscopic method using an Olympus stereo microscope. Microplastic photographs were taken by an inner imaging system, and the size of the microplastics was estimated using Image J software. Additionally, a portion of the microplastic samples was randomly selected for component analysis based on the shape, color, and size of the particles.        Our results indicate that microplastics are widely distributed in the surface seawater of the Xisha region. The abundance of microplastics was in the range of 10-130 pieces/m(3), with an average value of 54.7 pieces/m(3). The size range of microplastics was 0.02-5 mm with the length of 0.02-1 mm accounting for 32.1% and the length of 1-3 mm accounting for 64.8% of the total abundance. The microplastics from the Xisha region can be classified into five color types, namely transparent, blue, black, green, and red, with the average percentages being 56.8%, 40.2%, 1.2%, 1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, the local microplastics can be divided into fiber and film according to their morphology with fiber accounting for more than 99% of the total abundance. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) were the two major chemical components of the microplastics, accounting for 56.2% and 20.3% of the chemical components, respectively.        The average concentration of microplastics in Xisha region is relatively lower than that in many other regions of the South China Sea, as well as that in other regions of the global oceans. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of microplastics is influenced by water movement, anthropogenic activities, and topographic features in the Xisha region. Although there is a large spatial variation in the surface seawater in the Xisha region, the concentration of microplastics in the near-shore stations is typically high, which may indicate that the microplastics in these areas originate from terrestrial sources. On the other hand, a reduced wave energy due to the topographic structure of shallow coral reefs allows more microplastics to settle and accumulate in the nearshore waters around the islands. Meanwhile, there were nearshore stations (S12, S19, S22) with low microplastic abundance, particularly in areas with high internal tides caused by local topography, strong mixing or upwelling induced by internal tides, and waves. These phenomena can bring subsurface waters to the surface and thus lead to the dilution of surface seawater pollutants at the nearshore stations.        Analysis of microplastic morphology revealed the presence of large-diameter microplastic fibers in the surface seawater of the Xisha region, which may indicate that these microplastics are young in age. Most likely, they originated from recent fishery activities in the region, as both PET and PP are common types of plastics used in local fishery operations. Furthermore, microplastics have already been found in local soil samples and in the bodies of seabirds living on the Xisha Islands, due to an increase in island development and construction. Therefore, plastic waste discharge caused by increasing human activities may be another important source of microplastics to the surface seawater of the Xisha region.",NA,NA,NA

Of importance is the evaluation of contaminant impact differences across species to inform ecosystem protection and identify appropriate model species for human toxicity studies. Here we evaluated 2 complementary tools to predict cross-species differences in binding affinity between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and the liver fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP): the Sequence Alignment to Predict Across Species Susceptibility (SeqAPASS) tool and molecular dynamics (MD). SeqAPASS determined that the structure of human LFABP, a key determinant of PFAS bioaccumulation, was conserved in the majority of vertebrate species, indicating these species would have similar PFAS bioaccumulation potentials. Level 3 SeqAPASS evaluation identified several potentially destabilizing amino acid differences across species, which were generally supported by DUET stability change predictions. Nine single-residue mutations and 7 whole species sequences were selected for MD evaluation. One mutation (F50V for PFNA) showed a statistically significant difference with stronger affinity than wild-type human LFABP. Predicted binding affinities for 9 different PFAS across 7 species showed human, rat, chicken, and rainbow trout had similar binding affinities to one another for each PFAS, whereas Japanese medaka and fathead minnow had significantly weaker LFABP-binding affinity for some PFAS. Based on these analyses, the combined use of SeqAPASS and MD provides rapid screening for potential species differences with deeper structural insight. This approach can be easily extended to other important biological receptors and potential ligands.",NA,NA,NA

In this study adrenal and thyroidal feedback mechanisms were studied. Administration of corticosterone 30 min prior to an ovine CRH (oCRH) challenge diminished the in vivo sensitivity of thyrotrophs to oCRH in 19-day-old chicken embryos (E19) (20 mu g corticosterone; 2 mu g oCRH) but not in 8-day-old chickens (C8) (40 mu g corticosterone; 4 mu g oCRH). At both ages studied, corticosterone (0.01 and 1 mu M) did not alter the in vitro TSH response to oCRH (100 nM) indicating that an indirect mechanism is involved at the embryonic stage which is no longer present in posthatch chickens.        In vitro, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3) pretreatment (0.01 and 1 mu M) resulted at both ages studied in a dose-dependent drop in the in vitro oCRH-induced TSH release,As recorded previously, corticosterone treatment provoked a rise in plasma T-3 in embryonic but not in posthatch chickens. The presence of an indirect adrenal feedback mechanism in chicken embryos may therefore be linked to the increase in plasma T-a which will alter the sensitivity of thyrotrophs to hypothalamic releasing factors.        In conclusion, corticosterone does not directly modulate the responsiveness of thyrotrophs to CRH, but its feedback mechanism may be dependent on the evoked increase in plasma T-3 which is only present in embryonic chickens. Corticosterone may in this regard play an essential role during embryonic development by coordinating thyroidal feedback mechanisms at the level of the chicken pituitary.

Despite its benthic-inshore foraging strategy, the Black guillemot displayed overall similar contaminant concentrations in blood during incubation (Sigma PCB11(15.7 ng/g w.w.) > Sigma PFAS(5) (9.9 ng/g w.w.)> Sigma Pesticides(9) (6.7 ng/g w.w.) > Sigma PBDE4 (2.7 ng/g w.w.), and Hg (0.3 mu g/g d.w.) compared to an Arctic migratory seabird in which several contaminant-related stress responses have been observed. Black guillemots in poorer condition tended to display higher levels of contaminants, higher levels of reactive oxygen metabolites, lower plasmatic antioxidant capacity, and shorter telomere lengths; however the low sample size restrict any strong conclusions. Nevertheless, our data suggests that nonlinear relationships with a threshold may exist between accumulated contaminant concentrations and physiological status of the birds. These findings were used to build a hypothesis to be applied in future modelling for describing how chronic exposure to contaminants may be linked to telomere dynamics.

From a prospective study designed to examine cognitive function in the Seattle (WA) metropolitan area, blood samples were collected from 238 dementia-free subjects (ages 65-96). High-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry determined seven fluorochemicals: PFOS; N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate; N-methyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate; perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate; perfluorooctanesulfonamide; perfluorooctanoate; and perfluorohexanesulfonate.

Regional differences in the pattern of OHS were also found. Thus, the results indicate that nestling blood provides a good measure of territorial exposure. However, to create a better basis for evaluation of contaminant levels, more than one sampling year from each breeding territory is recommended. There is a significant negative correlation between the concentration of 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl and brood size. This observation indicates that present levels of coplanar PCBs may stilt influence the reproduction of white-tailed sea eagles on the Baltic coast.",NA,NA,NA

The Navigation Guide was developed to effectively and efficiently translate the available scientific evidence into timely prevention-oriented action.        OBJECTIVES: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review method to answer the question ""Does fetal developmental exposure to perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) or its salts affect fetal growth in animals ?"" and to rate the strength of the experimental animal evidence.        METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, applied prespecified criteria to the search results to identify relevant studies, extracted data from studies, obtained additional information from study authors, conducted meta-analyses, and rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence.        RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis of eight mouse gavage data sets, we estimated that exposure of pregnant mice to increasing concentrations of PFOA was associated with a change in mean pup birth weight of -0.023 g (95% CI: -0.029, -0.016) per 1-unit increase in dose (milligrams per kilogram body weight per day). The evidence, consisting of 15 mammalian and 6 nonmammalian studies, was rated as ""moderate"" and ""low"" quality, respectively.        CONCLUSION: Based on this first application of the Navigation Guide methodology, we found sufficient evidence that fetal developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth in animals.",NA,NA,NA

Different stages of CGNs maturation, between day in vitro (DIV) 1, 3, and 5 were exposed to the POP mixture, or PFOS alone. Their combination with glutamate, an excitatory endogenous neurotransmitter important in neurodevelopment, also known to cause excitotoxicity was evaluated. Outcomes with the mixture at 500x blood levels were compared to PFOS at its corresponding concentration of 20 ?M. The POP mixture reduced tetrazolium salt (MTT) conversion at earlier stages of maturation, compared to PFOS alone. Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity was enhanced above the level of that induced by glutamate alone, especially in mature CGNs at DIV5. Glutathione (GSH) concentrations seemed to set the level of sensitivity for the toxic insults from exposures to the pollutants. The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) mediated calcium influx in pollutant exposures was investigated using the non-competitive and competitive receptor antagonists MK-801 and CGP 39551. Observations indicate a calcium-independent, but still NMDA-R dependent mechanism in the absence of glutamate, and a calcium-and NMDA-R dependent one in the presence of glutamate. The outcomes for the POP mixture cannot be explained by PFOS alone, indicating that other chemicals in the mixture contribute its overall effect.",NA,NA,NA

Our objectives were to estimate PFA size and length of the post-fledging period for Northern Goshawk (A. g. laingi) nests on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We estimated PFA size from 95% adaptive kernel estimates of telemetry locations from 12 fledglings at 12 nests between 29 June and 2 September 2001-02 (N = 6, 2001; N = 6, 2002). Because Our adaptive kernel estimates are based on a small number of locations, we also estimated the precision of these home range estimates rising a smoothed bootstrap approach. Almost all (93%) fledgling locations were within 200 in of nests during the early fledgling-dependency period, but less than half (42.4%) of these locations were within this distance during the late fledgling-dependency period. Northern Goshawks departed from PFAs 45.9 +/- 1.3 d post-fledging. Mean PFA size was 59.2 +/- 16.1 ha, and the bootstrapped variance around PFA estimates ranged from 12.7-1820.8 ha. Our estimate for the mean size of one PFA per nest area for A. g. laingi fledglings on Vancouver Island was much smaller than the mean size estimate reported for A. g. atricapillus in New Mexico.

Agent Orange herbicide, contaminated with TCOD, was sprayed in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971 primarily for use as a defoliant. Typical blood TCCD Levels are 2 ppt in Vietnamese, but levels are as high as 413 ppt in Bien Him City. Elevated TCOD was found in children born many years after Agent Orange spraying ended and in immigrants from non-Agent Orange-sprayed parts of Vietnam, which documented new exposures. Extremely elevated soil TCOD samples, over I million ppt, and elevated TCOD in sediment were found in some nearby areas such as Bien Hung Lake. The primary route of intake of almost all dioxins in humans is food. However, in our prior studies in Bien Hoa, food was unavailable for dioxin analysis so the route of intake was not confirmed. In the 1970s, while Agent Orange was still being sprayed, elevated human, milk TCDD levels as high as 1850 were detected in milk from Vietnamese people living in Agent Orange-sprayed areas where consumption of fish was high. Furthermore, also in the 1970s, elevated TCDD levels (up to 810 ppt) were found in fish and shrimp from the same area as the milk donors. In the 1980s, we found elevated TCDD and also other organohalogen Levels in human tissue, pork, fish, a turtle, and a snake in Southern Vietnam. Tor these reasons, we recently collected food from Bien Hoa and analyzed it for dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT and its metabolites, and other organochlorines. We found marked elevation of TCOD, the dioxin characteristic of Agent Orange, in some of the food products, including ducks with 276 ppt and 331 ppt wet weight, chickens from 0.031-15 ppt wet weight, fish, from 0.063-65 ppt wet weight, and a toad with 56 ppt wet weight. Usual TCOD levels in food are less than 0.1 ppt. Total TEQ/or ducks was from 286-343 ppt wet weight or 536 ppt and 550 ppt lipid; for chickens from 0.35-48 ppt wet weight or 0.95-74 ppt lipid, for fish from 0.19- 66 ppt wet weight or 3.2 ppt and 15,34 9 ppt lipid, and the toad was 80 ppt wet weight and 11, 765 ppt lipid. Interestingly, this study did not find elevated levels of TCDD in the pork and beef samples. Clearly, food, including duck, chicken, some fish, and a load, appears responsible for elevated TCDD in residents of Bien Hoa City, even though the original Agent Orange contamination occurred 30-40 years before sampling. Elevated levels of PCBs and DDT and its metabolites were found in some food samples. Furthermore, measurable Levels of hexachloracyclohexanes (HCH) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were found in a wide range of measurable levels. All of the 11 dioxin-like PCBs measured and presented plus 6 dioxins in addition to TCDD and 10 dibenzofurans contributed to the total dioxin toxicity (TEQ).

Trifluoroacetate (tfa)-containing dirhodium compounds have been used to build artificial metalloenzymes upon reaction with peptides and have been shown to be more cytotoxic than dirhodium tetraacetate.

Contaminants may impair the humoral immunity and also influence the antioxidant enzyme activity (i.e. oxidative stress). Moreover, physical conditions and oxidative stress during development may reduce telomere lengths, one of the main mechanisms explaining cell senescence. To examine the potential effects of environmental contaminants on physiological biomarkers of health, OHCs with different 'physicochemical' properties were related to immunoglobulin Y levels (IgY; humoral immunity), superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity in blood plasma, and telomere length (measured in red blood cells) in individual 7-8 weeks old nestlings (n = 35) of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Norwegian Sub-Arctic. Different organochlorines (OCs) and perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) were measured in blood plasma of nestlings, demonstrating higher concentrations of the emerging contaminants (PFASs), notably perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compared to legacy OCs. There were no relationships between the contaminant loads and plasma IgY levels. Moreover, differences between years were found for telomere lengths, but this was not related to contaminants and more likely a result of different developmental conditions. However, there were significant and negative relationships between the OC loadings and the SOD activity. This suggests that some legacy OCs challenge the antioxidant capacity in nestlings of white-tailed eagles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

This reduced PFAS exposure via food and thus risk towards flamingos during the first years after the fires. Although the sediment is still polluted with persistent PFAS, flamingos returned, and started to feed on organisms with PFAS levels that exceed safety thresholds, placing the birds and other wildlife at risk.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), mirex, dichlorodiphenyltri-chloroetane and derivatives (DDTs) and chlordanes were detected in all birds, whereas polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were not detected in any blood samples. No significant differences were found in organochlorine levels between sampling events. Adults exhibited significantly higher levels than chicks, except for PeCB. PCBs, HCB, mirex and DDTs were statistically similar in males and females from Elephant Island. Females on Livingston Island exhibited higher HCB values than males, but no sex differences were found regarding other organochlorines. The similarity in organochlorine levels between sexes in birds with very marked sexual segregation in feeding habits during the breeding season may indicate that significant amounts of contaminants are acquired during migration to lower latitudes, when the diets of males and females are similar. Birds sampled on Livingston Island exhibited significantly lower levels of PCBs, HCB, DDTs, mirex and chlordanes in comparison to those on Elephant Island, which could be the result of distinct foraging patterns between the two colonies. Organochlorine levels were similar between years in birds captured in two consecutive breeding seasons. Blood samples from Southern Giant Petrels adults and chicks proved to be useful for the comparison of intraspecific contamination levels and appear to be adequate for the long-term assessment of organohalogen contaminants in antarctic top predators.

We investigated telomere lengths in WTE nestlings (n = 168) over 19 years and examined legacy POP concentrations (organochlorines and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) in whole blood and serum as potential drivers of differences in telomere length. Although we detected significant year-to-year variations in telomere lengths among the WTE nestlings, telomere lengths did not correlate with any of the investigated POP concentrations of several classes. Given that telomere lengths did not associate with POP contamination in the Baltic WTE nestlings, we propose that other environmental and biological factors, which likely fluctuate on a year-to-year basis, could be more important drivers of telomere lengths in this population.",NA,NA,NA

Most of the variation is due to changes in use and production, but environmental and biological factors may also contribute to the variation. Nestlings of top predators are exposed to maternally transferred OHCs in the egg and through their dietary intake after hatching. The present study investigated spatial and temporal variation of OHCs and the role of age and diet on these variations in plasma of Norwegian white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) nestlings. The nestlings were sampled at two locations, Smola and Steigen, in 2015 and 2016. The age of the nestlings was recorded (range: 44 87 days old) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and (delta N-15) were applied as dietary proxies for carbon source and trophic position, respectively. In total, 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, range: 0.82 - 59.05 ng/mL), 7 organochlorinated pesticides (0CPs, range: 0.89 - 52.19 ng/mL), 5 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, range: 0.03 - 2.64 ng/mL) and 8 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs, range: 4.58 - 52.94 ng/mL) were quantified in plasma samples from each location and year. The OHC concentrations, age and dietary proxies displayed temporal and spatial variations. The age of the nestlings was indicated as the most important predictor for OHC variation as the models displayed significantly decreasing plasma concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs with increasing age, while concentrations of PFASs were significantly increasing with age. Together with age, the variations in PCB, OCP and PBDE concentrations were also explained by delta C-13 and indicated decreasing concentrations with a more marine diet. Our findings emphasise age and diet as important factors to consider when investigating variations in plasma OHC concentrations in nestlings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Blood and serum samples of mass 0.2 g were examined. Such masses are consistent with those which may be obtained from many avian species without sacrificing individuals or compromising breeding and (or) migratory success. Extraction vessels are modified by the use of Teflon inserts, which are readily fabricated at low cost. These inserts reduce internal cell volume and surface area. Thus, background contamination is reduced whilst extraction and rinse solvent is used more effectively to afford a small extract volume. Packing of the cell void with sodium sulfate and florisil achieves in situ sample dehydration and lipid removal. When combined with extraction concentration and large volume injection gas chromatography - ion-trap mass spectrometry (LVI-GC-ITMS), the extraction method is capable of polychlorinated biphenyl analysis without post-extraction cleanup. Validation was accomplished using commercial chicken whole blood and serum, and PCB congeners 28, 77, 105, 126, 153, 167, 170, 180, 183, and 194.

When incorporated into chicken E, CD59 (purified from human E membranes) inhibited the cytolytic activity of the C5b-9 complex in a manner dependent on the species of origin of C8 and C9.  Inhibition of C5b-9-mediated hemolysis was maximal when C8 and C9 were derived from human (hu) or baboon serum.  By contrast, CD59 showed reduced activity when C8 and C9 were derived from dog or sheep serum, and no activity when C8 and C9 were derived from either rabbit or guinea pig (gp) serum.   Similar specificity on the basis of the species of origin of C8 and C9 was also observed for CD59 endogenous to the human E membrane, using functionally blocking antibody against this cell surface protein to selectively abrogate its C5b-9-inhibitory activity.  When E bearing human CD59 were exposed to C5b-8hu, CD59 was found to inhibit C5b-9-mediated lysis, regardless of the species of origin of C9, suggesting that the inhibitory function of CD59 can be mediated through recognition of species-specific domains expressed by human C8.  Consistent with this interpretation, CD59 was found to bind to C5b-8hu but not to C5b67hu or C5b67huC8gp.  Although CD59 failed to inhibit hemolysis mediated by C5b67huC8gpC9gp, its inhibitory function was observed for C5b67huC8gpC9hu, suggesting that, in addition to its interaction with C5b-8hu, CD59 also interacts in a species-selective manner with C9hu incorporated into C5b-9.  Consistent with this interpretation, CD59 was found to bind both C5b67huC8gpC9hu and C5b-8huC9gp, but not C5b67huC8gpC9gp.  Taken together, these data suggest that the capacity of CD59 to restrict the hemolytic activity of human serum complement involves a species-selective interaction of CD59, which involves binding to both the C8 and C9 components of the membrane attack complex.  Although CD59 expresses selectivity for C8 and C9 of human origin, this ""homologous restriction"" is not absolute, and this human complement regulatory protein retains functional activity toward C8 and C9 of some nonprimate species.",NA,NA,NA

Cells were exposed for 72 h to a defined mixture of POPs with chemical composition and concentrations based on blood levels in the Scandinavian population. We also evaluated perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) alone, the most abundant compound in the POP mixture. Only higher concentrations of POP mixture reduced tetrazolium salt (MTT) conversion. High-content analysis showed a decrease in cell number, but no changes for nuclear and mitochondrial cellular health parameters. Robust glutathione levels were observed in NGF-differentiated cells. Live imaging, using the IncuCyte ZOOM platform indicated ongoing cell proliferation over time, but slower in presence of NGF. The pollutants did not inhibit neuritogenesis, but rather increased NGF-induced neurite length. PFOS induced neurite outgrowth to about 50 % of the level seen with the POP mixture. Neither the POP mixture nor PFOS affected neurite length in the absence of NGF. Our observations indicate that realistic complex mixtures of environmental pollutants can affect neuronal connectivity via NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

A variety of polyfluorene (PF)-based binary delivery systems were designed and developed successfully, but PF-based ternary formulations remain rarely explored, likely due to the synthetic challenge. To develop a universal synthesis strategy toward linear conjugated amphiphilic triblock copolymer for cancer theranostics, herein we focused on the functionalization of the PF terminus for further chain extension and prepared well-defined PF-based amphiphilic triblock copolymers, PF-bpoly(epsilon-caprolactone)-b-poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate) (PF-b-PCL-b-POEGMA), by integrated state-of-the-art polymer chemistry techniques, including Suzuki reaction, ring-opening polymerization, atom transfer radical polymerization, and click coupling. The resulting conjugated amphiphilic triblock copolymers can self-assembe into core-shell-corona (CSC) micelles with PF block constructing the inner hydrophobic core for fluorescent tracking, PCL segment forming the hydrophobic middle shell for drug encapsulation, and POEGMA moiety building the hydrophilic outer corona for particulate stabilization. Interestingly, the CSC micelles with hydrophobic PCL middle layer show a greater drug loading capacity as well as a higher fluorescence quantum yield (Phi) relative to the core-shell micelles self-assembled from the control of PF-b-POEGMA diblock copolymers without PCL sequence due to having more hydrophobic spaces and better separation of PF sequence provided simultaneously by the PCL central block. The efficient cellular uptake of the anticancer drug doxorubicin-loaded CSC micelles together with the in vitro cytotoxicity against the HeLa cells makes the conjugated amphiphilic triblock copolymers developed herein a promising platform for simultaneous cell image and drug delivery, thus offering great potential for cancer theranostics.",NA,NA,NA

Molted feathers were collected at nest sites from northern, central and southern Norway across four summers (2013-2016). Additionally, two museum-archived feathers from 1979 to 1989 were included.

Geographic area and year were influential factors for delta 15N and delta 13C. Considerable spatial variation was observed in PFAS levels, with the southern area showing higher levels compared to northern and central Norway.

Therefore, a method was developed to reconstruct the fibroosseous pulleys with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane.  Twenty White Leghorn chickens had the A3 pulley of the long digit excised; this was followed by a standard injury to the flexor profundus tendon.  The A3 pulley was then reconstructed with PTFE membrane.  In the opposite foot, the A3 pulley was transected laterally, the tendon injured in the same manner, and the native pulley sutured.  Seven control chickens had a PTFE pulley reconstruction without tendon injury in one foot and the opposite foot did not undergo surgery.  At postoperative days 0, 21, and 35, the animals were killed to evaluate the effectiveness of the PTFE pulleys.  Flexor tendon function was assessed by determining the active range of motion of the digit.  There was no significant difference between the PTFE pulleys and suture repair of the native pulleys at postoperative days 21 and 35.  This indicates that the PTFE pulleys were capable of preventing tendon bow-stringing and did not significantly impair tendon gliding.  The breaking strength of the PTFE pulley was less than that of the normal A3 pulleys, but it was sufficient to allow immediate mobilization of the digits postoperatively without fear of pulley rupture.  The synthetic PTFE pulley appears to have the potential to function as an effective immediate replacement for the fibro-osseous pulleys.",NA,NA,NA

Six types of commercially available recycled materials were used either as bedding material for chickens or as fertilizer for cropland that later housed outdoor reared pigs. The contaminants studied included regulated contaminants e.g. polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs, dioxins) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), but related contaminants such as polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), hexabrominated cyclododecane (HBCDD), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), polybrominated dioxins (PBDD/Fs) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were also investigated. Contaminant occurrence in the recycled materials was verified prior to the studies and the relationship to tissue and egg concentrations in market ready animals was investigated using a weights of evidence approach. Contaminant uptake to animal tissues and eggs was observed in all the studies but the extent varied depending on the species and the recycled material. PCBs, PBDEs, PCDD/Fs, PCNs and PFAS showed the highest potential to transfer, with laying chickens showing the most pronounced effects. PBDD/Fs showed low concentrations in the recycled materials, making it difficult to evaluate potential transfer. Higher resulting occurrence levels in laying chickens relative to broilers suggests that period of contact with the materials may influence the extent of uptake in chickens. Bio-transfer factors (BTFs) estimated for PCDD/F and PCBs showed a greater magnitude for chicken muscle tissue relative to pigs with the highest values observed for PCBs in laying chickens. There were no significant differences between BTFs for the different chicken tissues which contrasted with the high BTF values for pigs liver relative to muscle. The study raises further questions which require investigation such as the effects of repeated or yearly application of recycled materials as fertilizers, and the batch homogeneity/consistency of available recycled materials.

These intermediates were used to study the lysis of CE by functionally purified C8 and C9 isolated from guinea pig and human serum. The results indicated that GPC9 was less efficient in lysing CEA1-8 or CE5678 than HuC9. This finding was observed irrespective of the species of C8 used. Experiments designed to analyze this difference indicated that there were two functionally distinct forms of C5b-8 that were randomly distributed among the cells but differed in their ability to generate a C lesion depending on the species of C9 used to complete the reaction. The implications of these results on the mechanism of generation of C lesions are briefly discussed.,"Cited By :6

To elucidate biotransformation relationships among BDE-47, 6-OH-BDE-47, and 6-MeO-BDE-47, dietary accumulation, maternal transfer, and tissue distribution of these compounds and their transformation products were investigated in sexually mature Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). In addition, transformation of each compound was determined in vitro using liver microsomes of medaka. OH-PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs were not detected in fish exposed to BDE-47. However, significant concentrations of 6-OH-BDE-47 were detected in medaka or microsomes exposed to 6-MeO-BDE-47. Significant concentrations of 6-MeO-BDE-47 were also measured in fish exposed to 6-OH-BDE-47, but 6-MeO-BDE-47 was not detected in microsomes exposed to 6-OH-BDE-47. Similar patterns of transformation products were observed in medaka eggs from adult fish during exposure. This study presents direct in vivo evidence of biotransformation of 6-MeO-BDE-47 to 6-OH-BDE-47. In addition, this is the first study to demonstrate biotransformation of 6-OH-BDE-47 to 6-MeO-BDE-47. Demethylation of 6-MeO-BDE-47 was the primary transformation pathway leading to formation of 6-OH-BDE-47 in medaka, while the previously hypothesized formation of OH-PBDEs from synthetic BDE-47 did not occur.

Their highly standardised sampling and archiving strategies make them a valuable tool in tracing time trends and spatial distributions of chemicals in ecosystem compartments. The present article intends to highlight the potential of ESBs for regulatory agencies in the European Union (EU). The arguments are supported by examples of retrospective monitoring studies conducted under the programme of the German ESB. These studies have evaluated the success of regulatory and industry provisions for substances of concern (i.e. PCB, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds, alkylphenol compounds, organotin compounds, triclosan/methyl-triclosan, musk fragrances). Time trend studies revealed for example that levels of organotin compounds in marine biota from German coastal waters decreased significantly after the EU had decided on a total ban of organotin-based antifoulings in 2003. Similarly, concentrations of commercially relevant congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers decreased in herring gull eggs from the North Sea only after an EU-wide ban in 2004. The data presented demonstrate the usefulness of ESB samples for (retrospective) time trend monitoring and underline the benefit of a more intensive cooperation between chemicals management and specimen banking.",NA,NA,NA

Chicken eggs were injected with varying doses of perfluorooctanoic acid prior to incubation. Observed were defects in hatching, increased incidence of splayed legs, and interference with the appropriate development of yellow plumage. All these defects are potentially related to essential molecular/biochemical and functional development of the chick.

Bioaccumulative CECs, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated substances, did not follow any upstream to downstream gradient; but both had significantly greater concentrations along the Maumee River than at the remote lake sites. Greater exposure to PBDEs was apparent in swallows at or near wastewater-treatment facilities than at other sites. Total polychlorinated biphenyl and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were greater in swallows at downstream locations compared to upstream sites and were associated with higher ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase activity. Few herbicides or nonorganochlorine insecticides were detected in swallow tissues or their food, except for atrazine and its metabolite desethylatrazine. Few pharmaceuticals and personal care products were detected except for DEET and iopamidol. Both were detected in most liver samples but not in eggs, as well as detected at the remote lake sites.

Spinal nerves in the forelimb region united with each other to form the primitive brachial plexus. Their terminal segment was covered by a peculiar cell mass. On E12, five primary branches developed along the primitive spinal nerve trunk. The ramus dorsalis was originally a cutaneous nerve, supplying two series of branches to the skin of the back. The medial series was derived from the dorsal ramus of C2-C8, and the lateral series from C8 and the more caudal dorsal rami. Nerves of the former series took the presegmental course through the intermyotomic space, while those of the latter the postsegmental course. The ramus cutaneus lateralis was a nerve that took the presegmental course to become cutaneous. The ramus intercostalis externus was a muscle branch whose distribution was restricted within the segment. The ramus anterior was a muscle branch from the end of the primitive spinal nerve trunk.

The surface tension of PTFE and PMMA was also determined using the Neumann et al. equation and the contact angle values for the aqueous solutions of the above mentioned ternary surfactants mixtures which were taken from the literature. As follows from our calculations mainly the presence of the fluorocarbon surfactant in the mixture considerably changes the surface properties of PTFE and PMMA causing that in contrast to hydrocarbon surfactants and their mixtures there is no linear dependence between adhesion and surface tension in the whole range of concentration of the ternary mixtures of surfactants including the fluorocarbon one. The behavior of fluorocarbon surfactants at the polymer-air and polymer-water interfaces is quite different from those of hydrocarbons.

In alkaline medium, ammonium was converted to ammonia, which diffused through the PTFE membrane to dissolve in an acceptor stream (water). Dissociation of ammonia caused a change in conductance of the acceptor solution, which was linearly proportional to the concentration of ammonium originally present in the injected solution. A conductometric flow through cell and an amplifier circuit was fabricated, which helped improve sensitivity of the conductometric detection system. With using a plumbing Teflon tape as a gas diffusion membrane and without thermostating control of the system, a linear calibration graph in range of 10-100 mg L-1 N-NH4 was obtained, with detection limit of 1 mg L-1 and good precision (relative standard deviation of 0.3% for 11 replicate injections of 50 mg L-1 N-NH4).

However, while there have been several studies on the effect of acoustic parameters on contrast, the effect of the droplet's stabilizing shell has not been studied as extensively. Inspired by previous studies showing lateral phase separation in microbubbles and vesicles, nanodroplets were formulated with a perfluorohexane core and a shell composed of varying amounts of saturated (DPPC) phospholipids, unsaturated (DOPC) phospholipids, and cholesterol, which were fractionated to obtain nanodroplets of mean diameter 300-400 nm and were stable over one week. When the DOPC content was increased to 40 mol%, ultrasound contrast increased by about one order of magnitude over DPPC-only droplets. Based on fluorescence microscopy results of lateral lipid phase separation on the droplet surface, the various combinations of DPPC, DOPC, and cholesterol were assigned to three regimes on the ternary phase diagram: solid-liquid ordered (low contrast), liquid ordered-liquid disordered (medium contrast), and solid-liquid disordered (high contrast). These regimes were confirmed by TEM analysis of nanoscale droplets. Droplets containing mixed lipid monolayers were also found to produce a significantly greater yield than single-component droplets.

No further clean‐up is normally required prior to chromatographic analysis of the analyte. A comparison was made of recoveries by in‐line and off‐line (after SF decompression) techniques for the SFE of three anabolic steroids in fortified chicken liver.

Methods: Directed evolution was used to engineer a small, disulfide-constrained cystine knot (knottin) peptide that bound to alpha(v)beta(3) integrins with a low nanomolar affinity (Knottin(Integrin)). A targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging contrast agent was created by attaching Knottin(Integrin) to the shell of perfluorocarbon-filled microbubbles (MB-Knottin(Integrin)). A knottin peptide with a scrambled sequence was used to create control microbubbles (MB-Knottin(Scrambled)). The binding of MB-Knottin(Integrin) and MB-Knottin(Scrambled) to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-positive cells and control cells was assessed in cell culture binding experiments and compared with that of microbubbles coupled to an anti-alpha(v)beta(3) integrin monoclonal antibody (MB(alpha v beta 3)) and microbubbles coupled to the peptidomimetic agent c(RGDfK) (MB(cRGD)). The in vivo imaging signals of contrast-enhanced ultrasound with the different types of microbubbles were quantified in 42 mice bearing human ovarian adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors by use of a high-resolution 40-MHz ultrasound system. Results: MB-Knottin(Integrin) attached significantly more to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-positive cells (1.76 +/- 0.49 [mean +/- SD] microbubbles per cell) than to control cells (0.07 +/- 0.006). Control MB-Knottin(Scrambled) adhered less to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-positive cells (0.15 +/- 0.12) than MB-Knottin(Integrin). After blocking of integrins, the attachment of MB-Knottin(Integrin) to avb3 integrin-positive cells decreased significantly. The in vivo ultrasound imaging signal was significantly higher after the administration of MB-Knottin(Integrin) than after the administration of MB alpha(v)beta(3) or control MB-Knottin(Scrambled). After in vivo blocking of integrin receptors, the imaging signal after the administration of MB-Knottin(Integrin) decreased significantly (by 64%). The imaging signals after the administration of MB-Knottin(Integrin) were not significantly different in the groups of tumor-bearing mice imaged with MB-Knottin(Integrin) and with MB(cRGD). Ex vivo immunofluorescence confirmed integrin expression on endothelial cells of human ovarian adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors. Conclusion: Integrin-binding knottin peptides can be conjugated to the surface of microbubbles and used for in vivo targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging of tumor angiogenesis. Our results demonstrate that microbubbles conjugated to small peptide-targeting ligands provide imaging signals higher than those provided by a large antibody molecule.",NA,NA,NA

Elevated levels of OHPs were found in the soil and chicken tissues. Soil was a more important source of OHPs, especially brominated flame retardants, than feed. In general, more-halogenated chemicals were less readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. With the exception of the brain and serum, where lower concentrations occurred, no significant differences in PCBs, PBDEs, and BTBPE were found among the chicken tissues. DBDPE was detected mainly in the stomach, intestine, lddney, and ovary. Compared with the soil, all the tissues had lower proportions of CBs 52 and 101. PBDEs were dominated by BDE 209 in the soil and chicken feed; two different PBDE congener profiles, dominated by both BDE 183 and BDE 209 or dominated by BDE 209 only, were found in the chicken tissues except for the brain. Only BDE 47 or BDE 209 was occasionally detectable in the brain. DBDPE was also found in the brain samples despite its high log values.

Geometric mean concentrations of total PBDEs (Sigma of nine congeners) ranged from 1.78 ng/mL in the upper St. Croix River watershed to 12.0 ng/mL on the Mississippi River. Lake Superior nestlings fell between these two extremes. Between 2006 and 2011, trends differed among study areas with three declining, two remaining stable, and one increasing. Variation in Sigma PBDE trends among study areas was linked to trends in individual congeners. The lower brominated PBDEs (BDE-47, -99, and -100) declined 4-10% while the higher brominated congeners (BDE-153 and -154) increased by about 7.0% annually from 2006 to 2011. This increase was the greatest in nestlings from the St. Croix River and below its confluence with the Mississippi River. Region-wide, our data suggest Sigma PBDEs increased in bald eagle nestlings from 1995 through the mid-2000s and then declined by 5.5% annually from 2006 to 2011.

In early embryos, nerve trunks of IX and X were lacking or only poorly developed, while the early development of pharyngeal branch primordia was normal. In day 5 embryos, the nerve trunks of IX-X were present in all the embryos, however; extensive communication was observed between X and XII. On day 6 and later, the spiral pattern of superior cardiac branches was disturbed, as were the blood vessels. Furthermore, the distal branches of XII passed within the superficial layer of cardiac outflow mesenchyme. Vagal branches passed within the deeper layer. There was no apparent change in the development of the sinal branch. Using quail - chick chimeras, it was found that the cardiac neural crest cells formed the Schwann cells of XII, and that they were also associated with the hypobranchial muscle primordium, suggesting that the absence of the cardiac neural crest not only disturbs the development of the cardiac outflow septation, but also affects the normal morphogenesis of the hypobranchial musculature and its innervation.

The study took place from April 1986 to May 1989.        The Department of San Luis del Palmar covers an area of 2551 km2  and is part of the Neotropical biogeographic region, Chacoan Dominion and Province7. The climate is of the subhumid type. The mean annual temperature is 21.6-degrees-C8. Some localities were chosen because of the presence of triatominae.        Households were carefully examined and classifield according to their building materials. A 0.2% solution of tetrametrine was sprayed in all possible hiding places to dislodge bugs, which were collected by capture/hour/man methods. A survey to determine the socioeconomical, sanitary, and cultural conditions of house-dwellers was carried out. The same method was used to examine peridomiciles and total demolition was carried out in the positive ones.        Fecal examination was carried out to verify the presence of T. cruzi in collected insects and observed at 400X. Human blood was obtained through venipuncture. The serum was kept in a freezer until examined. Serologic studies included indirect hemagglutination test (IHAT)10 and indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)1. Positive titer for IHAT and IFAT was 1/64. Seroreactives were those that had two positive assays. The whole data obtained was analized by X2 tests. From one hundred households studied, 80% belonged to huts and 20% to houses. Mud walls were predominant in huts while brick walls were predominant in houses. The roof of the huts was made of straw (46.2%), palm trees (33.3%) while laminated zinc was used in houses (70%) (Fig. 2, 3, 4, 5).        Bugs were detected in 46.3% of huts and in 45% of houses. T. infestans was predominant in domiciles, whereas T. sordida was more abundant in peridomiciles (Table 1).        A higher number of T. infestans was found in bedrooms with cracked walls (82% in huts and 87.5% in houses) and in a lower percentage in beds (Table 2). Forty four peridomestic structures (chicken and duck houses, store rooms, etc.) were analized (Fig. 6), 11% of them were positive to T. sordida and were dissected. The coexistence of T. sordida and T. infestans was verified in one of them. At least one T. infestans parasited by T. cruzi was found in 38.5% of the total number of infested domiciles while no infected T. sordida was found. From 175 human sera studied, 22.3% were reactive. The higher percentage of seroreactives (45%) was found among people over fifty, while only four children between the ages of three and ten resulted reactives (Table 6). Significant differences (X2 = 35,652; GL: 7; p = 7983 x 10(-6)) were observed in the different age groups. However, no significant differences were found between both sexes (masculine: 23.7%, feminine: 21.2%).        The variability in seropositive values reported by other authors for the province of Corrientes and the results obtained in this paper (22.3%) indicate how important it is to know the real prevalence of Chagas' disease in this Province taking into account that the data show more endemicity than was predicted.

Although polymeric delivery systems based on fluorescent polyfluorene (PF) or thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) have been extensively developed, the preparation of a ternary polymer formulation composed of a PF block, a PNIPAAm sequence, and a hydrophilic moiety remains rarely explored likely because of the difficulty in integrating different synthesis strategies for polymer synthesis. To this end, herein we reported the design and controlled synthesis of a PF- and PNIPAAm-based amphiphilic triblock copolymer, PF11-b-PNIPAAm(120)-b-poly(oligo (ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate)(17) (PF11-b-PNIPAAm(120)-b-POEGMA(17)), with a well-defined structure by a strategy of sequential click couplings between Suzuki-coupling-generated PF and atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)-produced PNIPAAm and POEGMA. The as-prepared triblock copolymers can self-assemble into micelles with a core-shell-corona (CSC) structure that is composed of an inner hydrophobic core of the PF moiety for fluorescent tracking and drug encapsulation, a thermosensitive middle shell of PNIPAAm block for thermomodulated drug loading and release, and a hydrophilic outer corona of the POEGMA segment for micelle stabilization. Interestingly, the doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded micelles prepared at 25 degrees C had a greater drug loading capacity than the analogues fabricated at 37 degrees C due to the better stability of the former formulation, leading to its higher in vitro cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. Together with the integration of a localized hyperthermia-triggered drug release profile and efficiently intracellular trafficking of the nanocarriers by monitoring the fluorescence of the PF moiety, this formulation demonstrates a great potential for cancer theranostics.",NA,NA,NA

About 60% of the global human population is currently living on the Asian continent and may thus be exposed to a large range of different chemicals. Different classes of organohalogen chemicals have indeed been reported in various environmental compartments from Asia including humans andwildlife, but this issue has received less attention in birds. In this article, we reviewed the available literature on levels of legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and various flame retardants (FRs) in Asian avifauna to analyze the existing pool of knowledge as well as to identify the gaps that should be addressed in future research. Furthermore, we discussed the variation in levels of organohalogens based on differences in regions, trophic level, dietary sources and migratory behaviors of species including distribution patterns in different tissues of birds. Although the mass of published literature is very low and even absent in many important regions of Asia, we deduced from the reported studies that levels of almost all classes of organohalogens (OHCs) including FRs were highest in East Asian countries such as Japan, China and South Korea, except for HCHs that were found at maximum levels in birds of South India. Concentrations (ng/g LW) of different OHCs in Asian birds ranged between <LOD (limit of detection) to 14,000,000 for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), <LOD to 790,000 for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), <LOD to 12,000 for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), <LOD to 29,000 for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), <LOD to 47,000 for chlordanes (CHLs) and <LOD to 4600 for total cyclodienes. Further, ranges (ng/g LW) of 1.1 to 150,000 for Co-PCBs; <LOD to 27 for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs); <LOD to 45 for polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and 0.02 to 73 for PCDD/DFs have been reported in Asian aves. Among emerging FRs, levels of total polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), total dechlorane plus (DPs) [syn and anti DPs] and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDs) oscillated between <LOD to 134,000, <LOD to 3820 [<0.1-920 and <0.1-2900], and <LOD to 11,800 ng/g LW, respectively. Corresponding ranges of novel brominated flame retardants (nBFRs) such as decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE) were bLOD to 820 and bLOD to 89 ng/g LW. Other nBFRs such as tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) hexabromobenzene (HBB) and pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) in Asian avifauna have been reported in very few studies. Dependence of organohalogens on dietary sources and subsequent biomagnification in the food chain has been corroborated through delta N-15 and delta C-13 stable isotope proxies. In general, tissues with higher fat content accumulated more organohalogens and vice versa. Aspects such as maternal transfer of OHCs and temporal trends have rarely been discussed in reported literature from Asia. The mobility of birds, vicinity to sources and trans-boundary movement of pollutants were identified as key exposure routes and subsequent OHCs contamination in Asian birds. There is extreme scarcity of literature on organohalogen contamination in birds from Northern, South-eastern and west Asian countries where an industrial boom has been witnessed in the past few decades.        Current scenarios suggest that levels of OHCs, particularly the FRs, are rising in birds of Asia and it would be wise to develop baseline information and to regulate the OHCs emission accordingly.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to test for impacts, especially for tags that are heavy and deployed for long time periods, such as satellite transmitters.        We marked 110 individuals of a medium-sized, migratory raptor, the black kite Milvus migrans, with GPS satellite tags, representing about 4% of the body mass and attached as backpacks through a Teflon harness. Tagged individuals were compared to control animals of similar sex, age and breeding status for a large number of behavioural, condition-related and ecological traits.        Despite a sample size two- to threefold greater than most previous assessments that reported significant impacts, there was no detectable difference between tagged and control individuals in key vital rates such as survival probability, longevity, recruitment, age of first breeding, reproductive performance and timing of breeding.        Tagged and untagged kites showed similar social dominance during fights over food and a similar capability to provision nestlings, which prevented carry-over effects on the stress levels and condition of their offspring.

Although the photochemistry of nitrate ions in bulk aqueous solution is well known, there is recent evidence that it may be more efficient at liquid-gas interfaces, and that the presence of other ions in solution may enhance interfacial reactivity. This study examines the 311 nm photolysis of thin aqueous films of ternary halide-nitrate salt mixtures (NaCl-NaBr-NaNO3) deposited on the walls of a Teflon chamber at 298 K. The films were generated by nebulizing aqueous 0.25 M NaNO3 solutions which had NaCl and NaBr added to vary the mole fraction of halide ions. Molar ratios of chloride to bromide ions were chosen to be 0.25, 1.0, or 4.0. The subsequent generation of gas phase NO2 and reactive halogen gases (Br-2, BrCl and Cl-2) were monitored with time. The rate of gas phase NO2 formation was shown to be enhanced by the addition of the halide ions to thin films containing only aqueous NaNO3. At [Cl-]/[Br-] <= 1.0, the NO2 enhancement was similar to that observed for binary NaBr-NaNO3 mixtures, while with excess chloride NO2 enhancement was similar to that observed for binary NaCl-NaNO3 mixtures. Molecular dynamics simulations predict that the halide ions draw nitrate ions closer to the interface where a less complete solvent shell allows more efficient escape of NO2 to the gas phase, and that bromide ions are more effective in bringing nitrate ions closer to the surface. The combination of theory and experiments suggests that under atmospheric conditions where nitrate ion photochemistry plays a role, the impact of other species such as halide ions should be taken into account in predicting the impacts of nitrate ion photochemistry.",NA,NA,NA

One particular Hox gene, referred to as Ghox 2.9, is initially expressed throughout the hindbrain up to the anterior border of rhombomere 4 (r4). Later, Ghox 2.9 is strongly upregulated in r4 and Ghox 2.9 protein is found in all neuroectodermal cells of r4 and in the hyoid crest cell population derived from this rhombomere. Using a polyclonal antibody, Ghox 2.9 was immunolocalized after transplanting r4 within the hindbrain. Wherever r4 was transplanted, Ghox 2.9 expression was cell-autonomous, both in the neuroectoderm of the graft and in the hyoid crest cell population originating from the graft.        In all vertebrates, rhombomeres and cranial nerves (nerves V, VII+VIII, IX, X) exhibit a stereotypic relationship: nerve V arises at the level of r2, nerve VII+VIII at r4 and nerves IX-X extend caudal to r6. To examine how rhombomere transplantation affects this pattern, operated embryos were stained with monoclonal antibodies E/C8 (for visualization of the PNS and of even-numbered rhombomeres) and HNK-1 (to detect crest cells and odd-numbered rhombomeres). Upon transplantation, rhombomeres did not change E/C8 or HNK-1 expression or their ability to produce crest cells. For example, transplanted r4 generated a lateral stream of crest cells irrespective of the site into which it was grafted. Moreover, later in development, ectopic r4 formed an additional cranial nerve root. In contrast, transplantation of r3 (lacks crest cells) into the region of r7 led to inhibition of nerve root formation in the host.        These findings emphasize that in contrast to spinal nerve segmentation, which entirely depends on the pattern of somites, cranial nerve patterning is brought about by factors intrinsic to rhombomeres and to the attached neural crest cell populations. The patterns of the neuroectoderm and of the PNS are specified early in hindbrain development and cannot be influenced by tissue transplantation. The observed cell-autonomous expression of Ghox 2.9 (and possibly also of other Hox genes) provides further evidence for the view that Hox gene expression underlies, at least in part, the segmental specification within the hindbrain neuroectoderm.",NA,NA,NA

The authors' objective is to selectively and noninvasively deposit markers under image guidance for such internal tattooing.        Methods: This study describes the production of new ultrasound-inducible droplets carrying large payloads of fluorescent markers and the in vivo proof of concept of their remote and controlled deposition via focused ultrasound. The droplets are monodispersed multiple emulsions produced in a microfluidic system, consisting of aqueous fluorescein in perfluorocarbon in water. Their conversion (either by vaporization or cavitation) is performed remotely using a clinical ultrasonic imaging probe.        Results: When submitted to 5 MHz imaging pulses, the droplets vaporize in vitro at 1.4 MPa peak-negative pressure and eject their content. After several seconds, a brightly fluorescent spot (0.5 mm diameter) is observed at the focus of the transducer. Experiments in the chorioallantoique membrane of chicken eggs and chicken embryo demonstrate that the spot is stable and is easily seen by naked eye.        Conclusions: These ultrasound-inducible multiple emulsions could be used to deliver large amounts of contrast agents, chemotherapy, and genetic materials in vivo using a conventional ultrasound scanner.

We examined the possible effects of 1.5-g geolocators (dimensions: 21 x 6.5 x 9 mm) on the breeding success and survival of migratory Lesser Kestrels (Falco naumanni). During the 2007 breeding season, kestrels were fitted with geolocators using two attachment methods (Teflon wing harnesses and darvic bands), and geolocators were removed in 2008 after the birds returned to the breeding grounds. We found no differences in the breeding success of control and tagged pairs during the 2007 breeding season, but tagged pairs had greater fledgling mortality in the following breeding season. Furthermore, nestlings of tagged individuals had higher triglyceride and uric acid concentrations in their blood than control nestlings during the breeding season following tagging. As for return rates, 75% of tagged birds came back to the colony after the nonbreeding period, a proportion similar to that reported in previous studies.

To date there are limited Whole Genome Sequencing based studies describing broiler-associated C. perfringens in healthy and diseased birds. Moreover, changes in the caecal microbiome during NE is currently not well characterised. Thus, the aim of this present study was to investigate C. perfringens virulence factors linked to health and diseased chickens, including identifying putative caecal microbiota signatures associated with NE. Results We analysed 88 broiler chicken C. perfringens genomes (representing 66 publicly available genomes and 22 newly sequenced genomes) using different phylogenomics approaches and identified a potential hypervirulent and globally-distributed clone spanning 20-year time-frame (1993-2013). These isolates harbored a greater number of virulence genes (including toxin and collagen adhesin genes) when compared to other isolates. Further genomic analysis indicated exclusive and overabundant presence of important NE-linked toxin genes including netB and tpeL in NE-associated broiler isolates. Secondary virulence genes including pfoA, cpb2, and collagen adhesin genes cna, cnaA and cnaD were also enriched in the NE-linked C. perfringens genomes. Moreover, an environmental isolate obtained from farm animal feeds was found to encode netB, suggesting potential reservoirs of NetB-positive C. perfringens strains (toxinotype G). We also analysed caecal samples from a small sub-set of 11 diseased and healthy broilers for exploratory microbiome investigation using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, which indicated a significant and positive correlation in genus Clostridium within the wider microbiota of those broilers diagnosed with NE, alongside reductions in beneficial microbiota members. Conclusions These data indicate a positive association of virulence genes including netB, pfoA, cpb2, tpeL and cna variants linked to NE-linked isolates. Potential global dissemination of specific hypervirulent lineage, coupled with distinctive microbiome profiles, highlights the need for further investigations, which will require a large worldwide sample collection from healthy and NE-associated birds.",NA,NA,NA

In addition, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of oils combined with partial least squares were applied to predict the FFA content, CV, and TPC content in oils. Results showed that the formation of SCFAs was accompanied the reduction of unsaturated fatty acids during 12 h/day for 3 days. For frying PCs with SO, the heptanoic acid (C7:0) continuously increased from 0.01 to 0.15 g/kg and octanoic acid (C8:0) increased from 0.008 to 0.65 g/kg, while the contents of linoleic and linolenic acids reduced from 45.69-41.43 to 4.03-3.20%, respectively.

In chicks, there is also an overlap zone, where both mechanisms work together. Homocysteine (Hcy) may have an important teratogenic role in neural tube defects (NTD) when folic acid levels are considered normal. Recently, Hcy capability to generate NTD and modify neural crest cell migration has been demonstrated in chick embryos. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of Hcy on neurulation and the development of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).        Methods: Chick embryos were treated with L-Hcy thiolactone 20 mumol to produce the highest rate of survival with embryos carrying neural tube defect (NTD) in the spine. Embryos at stages (st) 3-10 were treated and harvested at st 18-23. Only externally normal embryos or those carrying spinal NTD embryos were considered.        Results: Histological sections of Hcy-treated embryos showed: open spina bifida (39% of embryos), more than one tube forming the spinal cord (26%), disorganized spinal cord (26%), always affecting lumbosacral regions, probably in the overlap zone. Additionally, 32% of embryos had small and continuous DRG, associated with a slimmed roof plate. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed unsegmented DRG until the C8 ganglion level. There was a 75% reduction of C3 DRG cells in treated embryos in comparison to untreated ganglia.

For approving a chemical within the EU, producers need to conduct an environmental risk assessment, which typically relies on data generated under laboratory conditions without considering the ecological and landscape context. To address this gap and add information on emerging contaminants and chemical mixtures, we analysed 30 livers of white-tailed sea eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) from northern Germany with high resolution-mass spectrometry coupled to liquid and gas chromatography for the identification of >2400 contaminants. We then modelled the influence of trophic position (delta N-15), habitat (delta N-13) and landscape on chemical residues and screened for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) properties using an in silico model to unravel mismatches between predicted PBT properties and observed exposures. Despite having generally low PBT scores, most detected contaminants were medicinal products with oxfendazole and salicylamide being most frequent. Chemicals of the Stockholm Convention such as 4,4'-DDE and PCBs were present in all samples below toxicity thresholds. Among PFAS, especially PFOS showed elevated concentrations compared to other studies. In contrast, PFCA levels were low and increased with delta N-15, which indicated an increase with preying on piscivorous species. Among plant protection products, spiroxamine and simazine were frequently detected with increasing concentrations in agricultural landscapes. The in silico model has proven to be reliable for predicting PBT properties for most chemicals. However, chemical exposures in apex predators are complex and do not solely rely on intrinsic chemical properties but also on other factors such as ecology and landscape. We therefore recommend that ecological contexts, mixture toxicities, and chemical monitoring data should be more frequently considered in regulatory risk assessments, e.g. in a weight of evidence approach, to trigger risk management measures before adverse effects in individuals or populations start to manifest.",NA,NA,NA

As part of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, the US and Canadian governments have been charged with the protection of this system. Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBTs) contaminants were found to be affecting the lake water quality as early as the late 1960s, and various programs sponsored by the US and Canada have been created to monitor PBTs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). These programs have refined measurement techniques to quantify trace level contaminants using a targeted analytical approach. However, new PBTs are being detected in the environment, and the traditional targeted methodology is inadequate for understanding the complex chemical mixture affecting Great Lakes wildlife. Fortunately, new analytical technologies are emerging that allow for comprehensive screening of PBTs beyond targeted methods.

It was estimated that a ratio between the liquid overpressure and the nominal breakthrough pressure less than 1.5% could be a useful criterion to prevent membrane wetting and several actions were suggested to respect it.

Hepatic concentrations of DRCs and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; up to 200 ng/g wet wt) were significantly higher in male and female pigs, respectively, collected from the dumping site than in those from a reference site. Results suggest that dumping sites are a source of DRCs and PFOS. Hepatic concentrations of DRCs in piglets were higher than in mothers, especially for the congeners with molecular weights in the range of 360 to 400, implying congener-specific maternal transfer of DRCs in swine. Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and some non-ortho dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the liver of pigs were higher than those in the adipose fat and muscle of the same specimens. In addition, the liver-to-adipose concentration ratios for each congener had a significant positive correlation with the levels of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A-like protein, suggesting congener-specific and CYP1A-dependent hepatic sequestration of DRCs in the swine. Total hepatic 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents (TEQs; 8.9-350 pg/g fat wt) had a significant positive correlation with CYP1A-like protein expression (r= 0.56, p = 0.012), suggesting the induction of CYP1A by DRCs. However, the total TEQs had a significant negative correlation with CYP4A-like protein (r= -0.49, p= 0.029), suggesting repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha)-mediated signaling pathway by DRCs. Decreases in plasma total thyroxine (T-4), free T-4, and immunoglobulin (Ig) G were also found in pigs from the dumping site compared with those from the reference site.

Overall, results for 43 dead or dying bald eagles collected in the province indicate that 23% (10/43) of birds died of Pb poisoning and 9% (4/43) died of suspected Hg poisoning. Pb poisoning was diagnosed based on exceedances of toxicity thresholds in liver and kidney and supported by clinical observations, necropsy results, and histology findings when available. Evidence for Hg poisoning in eagles was limited; however, Hg concentrations exceeded the toxicity threshold in kidney. Pb concentrations ranged widely in liver and kidney. Total Hg concentrations were relatively higher in kidney compared with liver and were significantly correlated with selenium (Se) concentrations in both tissues. Concentrations of p,pE(1)-DDE and sum PCBs in livers of 12 bald eagles collected from 2001 to 2004 were likely below concentrations associated with adverse effects. Hepatic concentrations of total polybrominated diphenyl ethers were generally higher in birds collected from southern Ontario compared with northern Ontario. Potential impacts of exposure to these flame retardants and others are not known. Elevated metal exposure appears to influence survivorship and may affect the recovery of bald eagles in the province, particularly in southern Ontario and along the Great Lakes where a disproportionate number of poisoned eagles were collected. Increased efforts are needed to identify sources of exposure and develop measures to reduce metal exposure in this top predator.",NA,NA,NA

Organically complexed minerals have many advantages over inorganic sources. It has improved absorption and efficacy, which meets the bird's requirements comfortably with a low-dose level. Hence, inorganic forms can be replaced with lower-dose levels of organic minerals without any adverse effects on production performances in broilers and layers. PFAs possess medicinal properties, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, adaptogenic, and immunomodulatory, therefore, could be recommended as supplements. They are also growth promoters that enhance the overall health status and augment poultry birds' production performance. Furthermore, the tremendous potential of PFAs could be extracted with the recent advances in science and technology. With the advantages of organically complexed minerals and multiple beneficial applications, there is a resurgence to develop PFAs as a cocktail of organic minerals to improve the overall health status of poultry birds and augment their productivity, which, in turn, helps the poultry industry to grow decisively and economically.",NA,NA,NA

During 4 test sessions on 7, 8, 10, and 11 June 2010, we recorded 60 experimentally controlled logging trucks; 30 non-experimental, civilian, fixed-winged aircraft; 3 non-experimental, passing cars; and 1 all-terrain vehicle (ATV). Logging truck sound, principally engine and exhaust, was concentrated in the 63Hz and 80Hz, 1/3-octave frequency bands. Aircraft sound was concentrated in the 100Hz and 125Hz, 1/3-octave frequency bands. Logging truck noise levels varied among nest sites and with distance from roads. At 167m from the closest road, the logging truck averaged approximately 8 decibels (dB, all decibel levels C-weighted, adjusted, 1s, equivalent sound level, CLEQ) quieter than aircraft. At 143m, the logging truck was approximately 3dB quieter than passing aircraft. Only at 78m was logging truck noise louder on average than aircraft, by approximately 6dB. Average aircraft noise levels for each day of testing ranged between 45.6dB and 67.9dB and when averaged across the entire study period, varied little among the 3 test sites, 60.1-65.6dB. On average, our test logging truck (61.9dB) was no louder than passing aircraft (62.3dB), which goshawks generally ignored. The logging truck resulted in 27% no response and 73% alert (head turning) response, passing aircraft resulted in 90% no response and only 10% alert response, and the cars and ATV combined resulted in 50% each for no response and alert response. Goshawk alert response rates were inversely proportional to nest distance from the nearest road, decreasing from 91% to 57% alert between 78m and 167m. No movements or flushes were associated with either our experimental testing or passive recording of other vehicular noise stimuli. All tested pairs of goshawks successfully fledged young. Because logging truck noise had no effect on northern goshawks nesting along level 3, improved gravel roads on the Kaibab Plateau, restriction of log hauling and other road-based travel activities on similar roads within post-fledging family areas (PFAs) appears unnecessary based on the type and extent of our testing.

In addition to accumulation of a wide range of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners in both plasma and feathers, all non-PBDE BFRs and PFRs could be measured in feathers, while in plasma only two of six PFRs, i.e. tris-(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris-(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCPP) were detected. PER concentrations in feathers (0.95-3000 ng g(-1),) were much higher than selected organochlorines (005), such as polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (CB 153; 2.3-15 ng g(-1)) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE; 2.3-21 ng g(-1)), PBDEs (0.03-23 ng g(-1)) and non-PBDE BFRs (0.03-1.5 ng g(-1)). Non-significant associations of PFR concentrations in feathers with those in plasma (P >= 0.74), and their similarity to reported atmospheric (PFR concentrations, may suggest atmospheric PFR deposition on feathers.

Commercial products consist predominantly of penta-, octa-, and decabromodiphenyl ether mixtures, and global PBDE production is about 40,000 tons per year. PBDEs are bioaccumulated and biomagnified in the environment, and comparatively high levels are often found in aquatic biotopes from different parts of the world. During the mid-1970-1980s there was a substantial increase in the PBDE levers with time in both sediments and aquatic biota, whereas the latest Swedish data (pike and guillemot egg) may indicate that levels are at steady state or are decreasing. However, exponentially increasing PBDE levels have been observed in mother's milk during 1972-1997. Based on levels in food from 1999, the dietary intake of PBDE in Sweden has been estimated to be 0.05 mug per day. Characteristic end points of animal toxicity are hepatotoxicity, embryotoxicity, and thyroid effects as well as maternal toxicity during gestation. Recently, behavioral effects have been observed in mice on administration of PBDEs during a critical period after birth. Based on the critical effects reported in available studies, we consider the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) value of the PBDE group to be 1 mg/kg/day (primarily based on effects of pentaBDEs). In conclusion, with the scientific knowledge of today and based on Nordic intake data, the possible consumer health risk from PBDEs appears limited, as a factor of over 10(6) separates the estimated present mean dietary intake from the suggested LOAEL value. However, the presence of many and important data gaps, including those in carcinogenicity, reproduction, and developmental toxicity, as well as additional routes of exposure, make this conclusion only preliminary. Moreover, the time trend of PBDEs in human breast milk is alarming for the future.","Cited By :974

This population is expanding its range, presumably because of the use of human waste disposal sites as food resource. We hypothesized that habitat urbanization, presumably associated with feeding from human wastes, could influence the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants and metals. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between accumulated pollutants and biochemical parameters in nestling blood. We used the proportion of urban surface within an 8 km radius of each nest as a proxy to study the relationship between anthropic influence and pollutant accumulation. Observed blood levels of metals, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were relatively low, as expected for nestling individuals due to short-term exposures. CB-180 and PBDEs were associated with variations in blood biochemistry parameters; hexa-BDEs appeared positively associated with activities of the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, whereas CB-180 accumulation was associated with an increased activity of creatine phosphokinase and elevated glutathione levels. Increased CB-180 levels were also related to decreased blood concentrations of calcium, cholesterol, alpha-tocopherol and lutein. A proportion of urban surfaces as low as 6.56% within a radius of 8 km around the nest appears related to the accumulation of CB-180, the majority of analysed PFAS and of PBDE congeners 99 and 209, and increased urbanization was also associated with decreased plasma levels of alpha-tocopherol and carotenoids. These associations suggest that changes in blood profiles of vitamins, carotenoids or other analytes, despite related to increased plasma levels of CB-180, would be consequence of exploitation of artificial food sources rather than of a direct effect of the pollutants.

To date, it has been difficult to determine whether these compounds are natural products or derived from industrial synthesis. Molecular-level C-14 analysis of these compounds is particularly appealing because most industrial compounds are manufactured from petrochemicals (C-14-free) and natural compounds should have ""modern"" or ""contemporary"" C-14 levels. To investigate the source of DBP-Br4Cl2, we isolated 600 mug of this compound (150 mug of carbon) from marine animal extracts by employing gel permeation chromatography, Florisil column chromatography, and two-dimensional preparative Capillary gas chromatography. The purified DBP-Br4Cl2 was split into two samples (75 ug of carbon each) and analyzed by accelerator mass spectrometry for C-14 content. The Delta(14)C values were -449parts per thousand and -467parts per thousand, corresponding to conventional C-14 ages of 4740 and 5000 years before present (BP), respectively. The presence of detectable C-14 in the DBP-Br4Cl2 strongly points to at least a natural or biogenic source. However these Delta(14)C values for DBP-Br4Cl2 are more depleted than expected for a recently synthesized natural product.

Amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic peptides labeled with [H-3]borohydride revealed an N-linked carbohydrate moiety at the Asn18 residue. No O-linked carbohydrate was detected, as judged by the failure of asialo-CD59 to bind peanut agglutinin and by its resistance to digestion by O-glycanase. The apparent molecular mass of CD59 was reduced from 18-20 to 14 kDa upon complete digestion with N-glycanase, with no detectable proteolysis. N-glycanase digestion of CD59 was associated with an 88 +/- 4% loss of the complement-inhibitory activity of the protein, as assessed by its capacity to protect chicken erythrocytes from lysis by the human C5b-9 proteins. By contrast, no change in function was observed after digestion of CD59 with neuraminidase, under conditions that removed > 60% of [H-3]sialic acid residues. Despite loss of functional activity after N-glycanase digestion, we detected no change in the capacity of the deglycosylated CD59 to incorporate into erythrocyte membranes or to bind specifically and with species selectivity to the C8 and C9 components of the membrane attack complex. In order to alter the branched-chain structure of the N-linked carbohydrate of CD59 without enzymatic digestion, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with cDNA for human CD59 were grown in the alpha-mannosidase inhibitor, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, resulting in conversion of approximately 70% of the membrane glycoprotein to a high mannose. When grown in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin, the C5b-9-inhibitory activity of CD59 expressed on the surface of the transfected CHO cells was reduced by an amount comparable to that observed for the N-glycanase digested protein. Taken together, these data suggest that normal glycosylation of Asn18 in CD59 is required for the normal expression of its complement-inhibitory activity on membrane surfaces, although these N-linked sugar residues do not contribute to CD59's affinity for the C8 and C9 components of the C5b-9 complex.",NA,NA,NA
rayyan-830249239,PBDEs and PCBs in the liver of the St Lawrence Estuary beluga (Delphinapterus leucas): a comparison of levels and temporal trends with the blubber,2011,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,1464-0325,13,3,649-656,"Raach, M and Lebeuf, M and Pelletier, E",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Due to their lipophilic properties, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are commonly assessed using the blubber of marine mammals. However, these chemicals are also accumulating in other tissues including the liver. Some pollutants, namely perfluorinated alkyl acids, are found predominately in the liver and blood of marine mammals, and thus monitored in those tissues. This raises the question whether any tissue would represent an identical trend of POPs in the SLE beluga. The current study reports the first temporal trends of PBDEs and PCBs in the liver of 65 SLE belugas. Neither Sigma(7)PBDEs nor major individual PBDE-homolog group concentrations showed significant trends between 1993 and 2007. Also, Sigma(32)PCBs did not change over years, although, tetra-, penta-and hepta-PCB decreased by 7.1, 6.8 and 8.5%, respectively, in males, whereas tetra-, penta-and octa-PCBs declined by 11, 12 and 12.9%, respectively, in females. In order to compare the distribution of POPs between liver and blubber, a lipid normalised concentration ratio R(blubber/liver) for PBDEs and PCBs was calculated for each individual beluga. For all PBDE and several PCB homolog groups, mean R values were not statistically different from unity indicating that the partitioning of these POPs is governed by the tissue lipid-content. Temporal trends of R ratios of PBDEs and PCBs were also examined. There were generally no significant temporal trends except for PBDEs in males where R increased in average by 12.7 +/- 2.9% yearly. The stratification of the blubber into ametabolically active (inner) and less active layers (outer blubber) may result in a slower response time of the blubber (full depth) than the liver to the recent change of contamination in the environment and explain the time trend differences between both tissues. This study suggests that the liver is more representative of recent exposure to lipophilic contaminants.",NA,NA,NA

The polymers differed in both the size of the aromatic backbone and the length of the alkyl side chains. In agreement with studies on related conjugated polyelectrolytes, optical observations indicate that the surfactant breaks up clusters of the polymer and produces solutions of mixed polyelectrolyte-surfactant aggregates. The SANS data are in accord with the idea of dissolution and show that with C12E5 surfactant these polymers form long worm-like particles which contain rigid segments with the diameter of 5 nm. With the ternary system involving the polymer with a larger backbone, longer rigid segments were observed, for which a typical value of > 60 nm was calculated. In contrast, for the smaller polymer the value is around 45 nm. This difference is rationalized on the basis of the difference in polymer size.",NA,NA,NA

The objective of this project is to investigate the germicidal response on the surface of food-grade conveyor belt materials treated with pulsed ultraviolet (PUV) light. Four conveyor belt types including: a stainless-steel chain-link belt, a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated fabric belt, a solid pliable polymer belt, and a rigid-linked polymer belt, were evaluated for the inactivation of Escherichia coli K12-NSR strain and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Prior to bacterial inoculation, samples were classified as soiled or unsoiled, based on the presence or absence of pork intramuscular fluid on the surfaces of the conveyor samples. Using a variable speed conveyor, equipped with a Xenon flashlamp positioned 10-cm above the surface, each belt sample was exposed to PUV light at three fixed conveyor speeds: 3.05, 15.24, and 30.48 cm/sec, resulting in a total energy exposure of 3.31, 0.66 and 0.33 J/cm(2), respectively. For samples inoculated with E. coli K12-NSR, the surface condition (soiled or unsoiled) by treatment interaction was significant for microbial inactivation on the surface of the rigid polymer linked belt (P < 0.05). For samples inoculated with the LAB cocktail, the same interaction was significant for the PTFE-coated fabric belt and the solid pliable polymer belt (P < 0.05). Microbial reduction ranged from 0.74 to 5.04 log(10) CFU/cm(2) for E. coli K12-NSR and 0.63 to 4.61 Log(10) CFU/cm(2) for LAB for the evaluated treatment parameters.

The abdominal fat deposition, fat content, and FA composition of breast meat, thigh meat, and abdominal fat were measured. The accumulation rate (AR) of bioactive FAs in the tissues was estimated as the slope of the linear regression between the FA composition of tissues and diets. Results showed that a diet containing 6.4% MCTs reduced the abdominal fat deposition and fat content of thigh meat (P<0.05). Essential FAs had higher AR than did medium-chain FAs.

These findings are in contrast to those found for human, bovine and other mammalian MBP's. Mammalian MBP's, each of which contain seven or eight charge components depending on the analysis of the CM-52 chromatographic curves and the PAGE gels obtained under basic pH conditions. Chicken MBP components C1, C2 and C3 were treated with trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C. The resulting digests were analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography combined with either an ion trap tandem mass spectrometer or with a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. This instrumentation permitted establishing the amino acid composition and the determination of the post-translational modifications for each of the three charge components C1-C3. With the exception of N-terminal acetylation, the post-translational modifications were partial. The C1 component lacks any phosphorylated sites, a finding in agreement with the analysis of other MBP species. It also had a single methylation at R105 as did the components C2 and C3. The C2 component contains ten phosphorylated sites (S7, S18, S33, S64, S73, T96, S113, S141, S164, and S168), and modified arginine to citrulline residues at R24, and R165.

Already after 5 min, all of the five existing Cl-6-MBPs (HI-H5) were detected in the irradiated sample. Only one Cl-6-MBP (2,3,3',4',5,5'-hexachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-77, H2) has been previously described in the literature. H5 was identified as 2,3,3,4,4,5'-hexachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-75) by a specific fragment ion detected by GC/ECNI-MS. Fractionations of the irradiation mixture by reversed-phase HPLC followed by H-1 NMR analysis led to the structure of H4, i.e. 2,3,3,4,4',5-hexachloro-l-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-74).

The highest concentrations Of Cl-6-MBP isomers in the biota samples were found for MBP-76, MBP-77, and MBP-78. These congeners appeared to be the most lipophilic ones owing to the highest retention time in RP-HPLC.

In these samples, Q1 was more abundant than PCBs and on the level of DDT residues. Furthermore, Q1 was more abundant in seals from the Antarctic than the Arctic. To prove this assumption, gas chromatography-electron-capture negative ion mass spectrometry (GC/ECNI-MS), which is sensitive and selective for Q1, allowed for screening of traces of Q1 even in samples with particularly high levels of other organochlorine contaminants. Q1 was isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from a skua liver sample. A 1:1 mixture with trans-nonachlor in electron-capture detectors (ECDs) was used to determine the relative response factor with ECNI-MS. The ECNI-MS response of Q1 turned out to be 4.5 times higher than that of trans-nonachlor in an ECD. With GC/ECNI-MS in the selected ion-monitoring mode, four Antarctic and four Arctic air samples were investigated for the presence of Q1.

However, this method can be difficult, if samples are taken in remote areas, and costly, when the samples must be shipped on dry ice. Therefore, a more simple and cost effective method of preservation is essential for remote field work. Potassium dichromate (K(2)Cr(2)O(7)) has been successfully employed in the preservation of human and cows' milk as well as chicken eggs.        Our previous studies described the use of potassium dichromate for preservation of whole blood for analysis of dioxins, dibenzofurans, and PCBs. Potassium dichromate was found to successfully preserve blood at room temperature for 34 d with no significant differences in the measured concentrations of chemical contaminants or blood lipid level when compared to frozen samples. However, in a follow-up study, 3 months and 6 months of potassium dichromate preservation proved inadequate to preserve the samples for organic pollutant analysis. We noted that the lipid portion of the blood in the chemically preserved samples was declining in level or degrading, while the persistent organic pollutants remained intact at the same levels on a whole weight basis.        To narrow down the window of efficacy for the use of potassium dichromate to preserve blood samples for analysis, the present study compared chemical preservation to freezing for an intermediate time period, 2 months. Similar to our previous findings at 3 and 6 months, at 2 months significant lipid degradation was observed in the chemically preserved samples. Chemically preserved samples had significantly higher levels of organochlorine contaminants (dioxins, dibenzofurans, and PCBs) when measured on a blood lipid basis but not on a wet weight basis compared to frozen samples. While 2 months of potassium dichromate preservation was not useful for obtaining accurate measure of dioxins, furans, and PCBs on a lipid basis, previous studies found this method of preservation to be useful for at least one month (Schecter, A., Pavuk, M., Papke, O., Malisch, R., 2004.

This study revealed that the biodegradable PFP-TNDs is a promising therapeutic gene carrier with functions of gene protection and effective gene delivery for clinical applications.

The contaminants described in this overview are various metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn) and various organic contaminants (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and lindane (hexachlorocyclohexane, gamma-HCH)). In addition, information is presented about other and emerging contaminants such as antifouling biocides (e.g. TBT and Irgarol), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), poly- and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs).        Special attention is given to biogeochemical processes that contribute to the mobilization of contaminants in the surface sediments of the Wadden Sea. Finally, the effects on organisms of contaminants are reviewed and discussed.        The main source of contaminants in the Wadden Sea are the rivers Rhine (via de Dutch coastal zone), Elbe and Weser. The Wadden Sea is not a sink for contaminants and adsorbed contaminants are transported from east to west. The surface sediments of the Wadden Sea are an important source for contaminants to the water above. The input and concentration of most contaminants have significantly decreased in water, sediments, organisms (e.g., mussel, flounder and bird eggs) in various parts of the Wadden Sea in the last three decades. Remarkably, the Cd concentration in mussels is increasing the last decades.        In recent decades, the effects of contaminants on organisms (e.g., flounder, seal) have fallen markedly. Most of the affected populations have recovered, except for TBT induced effects in snails. Little is known about the concentration and effects of most emerging contaminants and the complex environmental mixtures of contaminants. It is recommended to install an international coordinated monitoring programme for contaminants and their effects in the whole Wadden Sea and to identify the chemical contaminants that really cause the effect.

The aim of this study was to examine possible endocrine-disruptive effects of dietary POP exposure in male juvenile Arctic foxes in a controlled exposure experiment. The study was conducted using domesticated farmed blue foxes (Vulpes lagopus) as a model species. Two groups of newly weaned male foxes received a diet supplemented with either minke whale (Baleneoptera acutorostrata) blubber that was naturally contaminated with POP (exposed group, n = 5 or 21), or pork (Sus scrofa) fat (control group, n = 5 or 21). When the foxes were 6 mo old and had received the 2 diets for approximately 4 mo (147 d), effects of the dietary exposure to POP on plasma concentrations of testosterone (T), thyroid hormones (TH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), retinol (vitamin A), and tocopherol (viramin E) were examined. At sampling, the total body concentrations of 104 PCB congeners were 0.1 +/- 0.03 mu g/g lipid weight (l.w.; n = 5 [mean +/- standard deviation]) and 1.5 +/- 0.17 mu g/g l.w.

Plasma testosterone concentrations in the exposed male foxes were significantly lower than in the control males, being approximately 25% of that in the exposed foxes. There were no between-treatment differences for TH, TSH, retinol, or tocopherol. The results suggest that the high POP levels experienced by costal populations of Arctic foxes, such as in Svalbard and Iceland, may result in delayed masculine maturation during adolescence.

A total of 234 CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates collected from chickens from 2014 to 2016 were screened for the presence of plasmid-mediated fosfomycin resistance genes (fosA, fosA3, and fosC2). Clonal relatedness of fosA3-positive isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The genetic environment of fosA3 was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mapping. Plasmids were studied by using conjugation experiments, PCR-based replicon typing and plasmid MLST. Sixty-four (27.4%) fosA3-positive E. coli isolates were identified in this study.

The complement-inhibitory activity of CD59 is species-selective and is most effective toward C9 derived from human or other primate plasma. By contrast, rabbit C9, which can substitute for human C9 in the membrane attack complex, mediates unrestricted lysis of human cells. To identify the peptide segment of human C9 that is recognized by CD59, rabbit C9 cDNA clones were isolated, characterized, and used to construct hybrid cDNAs for expression of full-length human/rabbit C9 chimeras in COS-7 cells. Ah resulting chimeras were hemolytically active, when tested against chicken erythrocytes bearing C5b-8 complexes. Assays performed in the presence or absence of CD59 revealed that this inhibitor reduced the hemolytic activity of those chimeras containing human C9 sequence between residues 334-415, irrespective of whether the remainder of the protein contained human or rabbit sequence. By contrast, when this segment of C9 contained rabbit sequence, lytic activity was unaffected by CD59. These data establish that human C9 residues 334-415 contain the site recognized by CD59, and they suggest that sequence variability within this segment of C9 is responsible for the observed species-selective inhibitory activity of CD59.",NA,NA,NA

At these conditions, ethyl oleate (C18:1) decomposed completely to form cis-trans isomers as well as ethyl octadecanoate (C18:0), which was attributed to double bond hydrogenation reactions. Short chain ethyl esters and glycerol decomposition products have the potential to benefit certain properties of the fuel such as viscosity and cold flow.",NA,NA,NA

The extraction solvent, methanol, was used for a static extraction time of 5 min, and repeated three times. Fifty milligrams of adsorbents C18/PSA (1 : 1, W/W) were added to the extraction cell to achieve simultaneous extraction and purification. The extraction efficiency of three solvents, methanol, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, was investigated. An orthogonal experimental design was used to explore the optimal combination of extraction temperature, static extraction time, number of extraction cycles, and adsorbent ratio for accelerated solvent extraction. After the optimal ratio was determined, the dosage of adsorbents was optimized. The extracted sample solution was concentrated by blowing nitrogen, redissolved, passed through a 0.22 mu m PTFE membrane filter, then injected for instrumental analysis. The validation results showed that the recovery of the proposed method was 60.4-107.6%, the limit of detection 0.2-3.0 mu g kg(-1), and the limit of quantification 0.5-8.3 mu g kg(-1).

The present study investigated if environmental exposure to OHCs may influence the variation of multiple physiological parameters in Norwegian white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) nestlings. Plasma and feather samples were obtained from 70 nestlings at two archipelagos in Norway in 2015 and 2016. The selected physiological parameters were plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones (thyroxine, T4 and triiodothyronine, T3), plasma proteins (prealbumin, albumin, alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-, beta-and gamma-globulins) and selected blood clinical chemical parameters (BCCPs) associated with liver and kidney functioning. Feather concentrations of corticosterone (CORTf) were also included to investigate the overall stress level of the nestlings. Concentrations of all studied physiological parameters were within the ranges of those found in other species of free-living birds of prey nestlings and indicated that the white-tailed eagle nestlings were in good health. Our statistical models indicated that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and legacy OHCs, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorinated pesticides and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, influenced only a minor fraction of the variation of plasma thyroid hormones, prealbumin and CORTf (5-15%), and partly explained the selected BCCPs (< 26%). Most of the variation in each studied physiological parameter was explained by variation between nests, which is most likely due to natural physiological variation of nestlings in these nests. This indicates the importance of accounting for between nest variation in future studies. In the present nestlings, OHC concentrations were relatively low and seem to have played a secondary role compared to natural variation concerning the variation of physiological parameters. However, our study also indicates a potential for OHC-induced effects on thyroid hormones, CORTf, prealbumin and BCCPs, which could be of concern in birds exposed to higher OHC concentrations than the present white-tailed eagle nestlings.",NA,NA,NA

Body feathers from the White-tailed eagles were also analysed and significant associations between specific PFASs in blood plasma and body feathers were found (0.36 < R-2 < 0.67; all p < 0.05). This result suggests that analysing body feathers of White-tailed eagle could potentially be a useful non-invasive strategy to monitor PFASs exposure in nestlings of this species. White-tailed eagles showed significantly higher levels of contaminants than Northern goshawks (plasma EPFASs Median = 45.83 vs 17.02 ng(-1), p < 0.05). The different exposure between both species seemed to be related to different dietary input, as quantified by stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of body feathers. A priori, the bird of prey populations studied are not at risk for PFASs, since the levels in plasma of both species were hundreds to thousand times lower than the toxic reference values reported for predatory birds.

The birds were castrated at 9 wk of age and bred until 140 d of age. Forty Amarela (20 roosters and 20 capons-castrated male) and 40 Pedres Portuguesa (20 roosters and 20 capons) breed chickens, 5 free-range chickens, and 5 broilers were used. From the breast, leg, and wing muscles, physicochemical parameters such as pH, water activity (a(w)), physical color, moisture content, ash, CP, pigments, collagen, and total fat and fatty acids profile, were analyzed according to standard procedures. Caponization did not affect pH, a(w), lightness (L*), yellowness (b*), ash, protein, collagen, saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA)/SFA. Results show that caponization decreased (P <= 0.05) moisture content and increased (P <= 0.05) pigments and intramuscular fat content. Capons showed higher (P <= 0.001) redness (a*) and chroma (C*), and lower (P <= 0.001) hue (H*) compared to roosters. Caponization increased (P <= 0.05) monounsaturated fatty acids content and PUFA/SFA. The main fatty acids found were oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0), and linoleic (C18:2). Capons had greater (P <= 0.05) C18:1 content but lower (P <= 0.01) butyric acid (C4:0), caprylic acid (C8:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and (P <= 0.05) arachidonic acid (C20.4) content than roosters. The objective of sensory analysis was making the comparison of the Amarela and Pedres meat with a free-range chicken and a broiler. Panelists classified the capon meat (Amarela and Pedres) as juicier and less tough and fibrous than rooster meat. Broilers were in general juicier, tenderer, and less fibrous than the other chickens in this study.

Primary chicken hepatocytes, which constitutively express a C-type lectin that binds to nonreducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues, were labeled with a fluorescent dye and incubated in 1.3-muL aliquots on the glycosylated spots. After incubating to allow cell adhesion, nonadherent cells were removed by immersing the slide in phosphate buffered saline, inverting, and centrifuging in a sealed custom acrylic chamber so that cells on the derivatized spots were subjected to a uniform and controlled centrifugal detachment force while avoiding an air-liquid interface. After centrifugation, adherent cells were fixed in place and detected by fluorescent imaging. Chicken hepatocytes bound to nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues in different linkages and orientations but not to nonreducing terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. Addition of soluble GlcNAc (but not Gal) prior to incubation reduced cell adhesion to background levels. Extension of the method to CD4(+) human T-cells on a 45-glycan diversity array revealed specific adhesion to the sialyl Lewis x structure.

A total of 120 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were used and the study was conducted on 4 main groups of broilers; one control and three trials. The birds in the control group was fed an unadulterated basal diet and those in the experimental groups were fed with 0.2% of caprylic, capric and lauric acids (in addition to a basal diet) respectively. In the study, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of mean live weight gain, feed consumption, feed conversion rate, serum glucose, total cholesterol, total protein and albumin (P>0.05). However, the triglyceride levels were detected to be significantly lower in the experimental groups (P<0.05) than control group. Seventeen different types of fatty acids were determined and were profiled from breast meat samples and it was indicated that most of fatty acid types showed statistically significant differences (P<0.05) among the experimental groups. As a result, it was concluded that the addition of 0.2% of free caprylic, capric or lauric acids to broiler diets generally did not result in specific performance effects among the groups but significant differences occurred in the meat fatty acid profile. The most important changes were the increases of total n-3 levels and the decreases of total n-6 and n-6/n-3 levels, in fatty acid supplemented groups. It was also found that lauric acid was accumulated significantly in poultry meat. The data suggests that the use of medium-chain fatty acid in broiler rations may change poultry meat fat composition in a way that positively affects human health and also prolongs shelf life.",NA,NA,NA

The objective of this research is to validate the hybrid mixture based unsaturated transport theory of Takhar (2014) via controlled frying experiments. A hollow Teflon disc is used to insulate the edges of potato disc to ensure that frying is controlled, one-dimensional, and oil uptake and moisture loss happen only through top and bottom surfaces. The model was used to predict moisture and oil content, evaporation rates, temperature distribution, and pore and gas pressure profiles as a function of frying time and temperature. Percentage average absolute difference (AAD) between predicted and experimental values for moisture content was 3.89%, 5.7% and 5.5% and oil content was 14%, 31% and 20% at 150, 170 and 190 degrees C respectively. Simulations showed that oil penetrated to only 0.5 mm into the potato disc. Removal of surface oil improved the prediction of experimental oil content. Maximum evaporation rate of 0.13 kg/m(3) s was observed near the surface of potato slice at 150 s frying time resulting in rapid moisture loss. Pore pressure remained negative beyond 90 s frying time, which may act as a driving force for oil uptake. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The perfusion procedure described allowed the control of intestinal and vascular inflow rates and perfusion pressures so that these parameters could be adjusted to physiological values. A perfluorochemical emulsion was used as oxygen carrier for the vascular perfusate. The absorptive function of the perfused tissue was assessed by means of its ability to transport 3-O-methyl-D-glucose. Furthermore, ultrastructure preservation was evaluated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results indicate that the perfused tissue kept its transport capacity and morphology intact throughout the 120-min experimental period. Moreover, no hypersecretion was observed as indicated by the constancy of perfusate volumes and perfusion pressures. Phloretin (1mM) or theophylline (10 mM) added to the vascular perfusate markedly reduced the transfer of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose from the enterocyte to the vascular fluid without affecting the uptake from the lumen. Our results suggest that this preparation may be used as an alternative tool for the study of intestinal absorption processes in avian species, particularly when complete examination is required of the efflux of substrates from the intestinal lumen to the vascular fluid.",NA,NA,NA

The prepared MIP coated stir bar presented a uniform and porous surface as well as good chemical stability and selectivity for melamine. Based on it, a method of MIP coated stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) combined with high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) was developed for the quantification of melamine in food samples. Significant factors affecting the extraction efficiency of melamine by MIP-SBSE, such as the extraction solvent and time, stirring rate, desorption solvent and time, were investigated thoroughly. Under the optimal conditions, the analytical performance of this method was evaluated. The detection limit of the developed method was 0.54 mu g L-1 for melamine with an enrichment factor of 42-fold and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of 6.1% (c = 5 mu g L-1, n = 7), and the linear range was 2-200 mu g L-1. The established method was applied for the determination of melamine in a variety of real samples including cat food, dog food, chicken feed A, chicken feed B and milk powder, and the recoveries for melamine in the spiked samples were in the range of 76.2-98.2%, 80.0-85.5%, 89.5-113%, 85.0-95.5% and 65.0-111%, respectively.

Our study presents a broad investigation of both legacy POPs and ECs in non-destructive matrices from a bird of prey. Plasma and feathers were sampled in 2015 and 2016 from 70 whitetailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) nestlings from two archipelagos in Norway. Preen oil was also sampled in 2016. Samples were analysed for POPs (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs)) and ECs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), dechlorane plus (DPs), phosphate and novel brominated flame retardants (PFRs and NBFRs)). A total of nine PCBs, three OCPs, one PBDE and one PFAS were detected in over 50% of the plasma and feather samples within each sampling year and location.        Significant and positive correlations were found between plasma, feathers and preen oil concentrations of legacy POPs and confirm the findings of previous research on the usefulness of these matrices for non-destructive monitoring. In contrast, the suitability of feathers for ECs seems to be limited. Detection frequencies (DF) of PFASs were higher in plasma (mean DF: 78%) than in feathers (mean DF: 38%). Only perfluoroundecanoic acid could be quantified in over 50% of both plasma and feather samples, yet their correlation was poor and not significant. The detection frequencies of PFRs, NBFRs and DPs were very low in plasma (mean DF: 1-13%), compared to feathers (mean DF: 10-57%). This may suggest external atmospheric deposition, rapid internal biotransformation or excretion of these compounds. Accordingly, we suggest prioritising plasma for PFASs analyses, while the sources of PFRs, NBFRs and DPs in feathers and plasma need further investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate how OHC exposure may affect biochemical pathways we collected blood plasma from Norwegian northern goshawk (n=56), golden eagle (n=12) and white-tailed eagle (n=36) nestlings during three consecutive breeding seasons. We found that blood plasma concentrations of calcium, sodium, creatinine, cholesterol, albumin, total protein, urea, inorganic phosphate, protein:creatinine, urea:-creatinine and uric acid:creatinine ratios and liver enzymes ALKP and ALAT were positively correlated to PCBs, chlordanes, pp'-DDE, HCB, PFCs and/or PBDEs. Total bilirubin and glucose were negatively correlated to PCBs while magnesium and potassium were negatively correlated to HCB and p,p'-DDE. In addition, protein:creatinine and ALAT were also negatively correlated to PCBs and PFCs, respectively. The most significant relationships were found for the highly contaminated northern goshawks and white-tailed eagles. The statistical relationships between OHCs and BCCPs indicate that biochemical pathways could be influenced while it is uncertain if such changes have any health effects. The OHC concentrations were below concentrations causing reproductive toxicity in adults of other raptor species but similar to those of concern for endocrine disruption of thyroid hormones in e.g., bald eagles.

Here, the cDNA of a CD59 analogue was cloned from large yellow croaker (Pseudosciana crocea), a marine fish (LycCD59), by expressed sequence tags (EST) and RACE techniques. The open reading frame (ORF) of 351 nucleotides (nt) of LycCD59 encodes a polypeptide of 117 amino acids (aa), which includes a putative 20-aa NH2-signal peptide and a 97-aa coding region with a putative GPI-anchoring site at Asn(71). The deduced LycCD59 protein shared the structural feature of mammalian CD59, including a conserved cysteine skeleton responsible for the formation of,disulfide bonds, and a similar pattern of hydrophobic termini. RT-PCR analysis showed that LycCD59 mRNA was broadly expressed in various tissues examined, except for intestine. And Northern blot analysis revealed a single LycCD59 transcript of approximately 1.0 kb. LycCD59 expression in blood, spleen, and kidney was significantly up-regulated during 24 h of induction with poly(I:C) or inactivated trivalent bacterial vaccine as determined by a relative quantitative real-time PCR analysis, and a coordinated up-regulation of LycCD59 and complement C3 and C7 mRNA was also found in these three tissues post-induction although their up-regulation pattern and extent were somewhat different in various tissues with poly(I:C) or bacterial vaccine. The recombinant protein of LycCD59 produced in E. coli was shown to significantly inhibit the erythrocyte lysis of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in an in vitro hemolytic system, which was mediated by serum from large yellow croaker and tilapia, respectively, but not from mouse and chicken, suggesting that LycCD59 has a species- selective inhibition of complement activation. These results represent the first functional identification of a CD59 analogue in teleost fish, strongly suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanism for terminal complement pathway in teleost fish.

In this work, the relationship between copper potentially present during food elaboration and N (epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine (CML) concentrations, has been examined for the first time. For CML determination, a reversed phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry procedure, based on acid hydrolysis, ethyl chloroformate derivatization and quantification in MRM mode was set-up, yielding method quantification limit of 98 A mu g kg(-1); copper was determined by ICP-MS. For eleven commercial cheeses, CML and Cu were found in the ranges 3.70-8.58 A mu g g(-1) and 0.08-15.5 A mu g g(-1), respectively, suggesting an inverse relation between these two parameters. For beef, chicken, Mexican pork ""carnitas"" and salmon, the CML concentration was lower in the item cooked in Cu casserole while element concentration was increased, as compared to this same raw material prepared in Teflon (TM) (except for ""carnitas""). Concentration-dependent effect of Cu, manifest by decreased CML formation, was confirmed evaluating conversion percentage of chemically protected lysine (ZLys) to ZCML in the absence and in the presence of different Cu concentrations (50.0% and 20.4% conversion for Cu:ZLys molar ratio 0:1 and 0.04:1, respectively). Consistent results obtained in the analysis of three different sample types point to the inhibitory effect of copper during CML formation; however, it should be stressed that Cu is only one parameter within a complex set of factors/conditions involved in glycation process. Although better understanding of the observed effect at molecular level is needed, the results obtained in this work strongly suggest beneficial effect of copper, inhibiting glycation process during food elaboration.",NA,NA,NA

Using a sensitive radioreceptor assay, we show that rat spinal cord extracts were able to inhibit binding of FLFQPQRFamide, suggesting that a biologically active FLFQPQRFamide-like material exists in the rat spinal cord.  We also raised antibodies against the peptide and used them, together with radioimmunological and immunohistochemical methods, to characterize this material further and analyse its cellular and subcellular localization in this area of the central nervous system.        Radioimmunoassay showed that extracts from cervical and thoracolumbar levels contained measurable amounts of FLFQPQRFamide-immunoreactive material (about 3 ng/g tissue), present essentially in the dorsal horn.  Analytical reverse-phase chromatography revealed that this material existed in several molecular forms.  One of these fractions (about 20% of the total immunoreactivity) had the elution characteristics of synthetic FLFQPQRFamide.  Light microscopic immunohistochemistry showed FLFQPQRFamide immunoreactivity at all spinal levels, localized mainly in a dense plexus of fibers in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn.  Immunoreactive profiles were also seen in the lateral funiculi and around the central canal at all levels and in the intermediolateral columns; some rare immunoreactive fibers were also noted in the ventral horn at cervical and thoracic levels.  FLFQPQRFamide-positive cell bodies were never detected in any of our sections.  Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of the dorsal horn and central gray treated with our antisera and a post-embedding immunogold procedure revealed that the immunoreactivity, at least within these areas, was restricted to dense-cored vesicles (90-120 nm in diameter) in axonal and terminal profiles.  As seen by radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry, unilateral rhizotomy of all dorsal roots between segments C4 and T2 did not change the levels of FLFQPQRFamide immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral C6-C8 segments.        Taken together with our recent data showing the existence of specific FLFQPQRFamide receptors at the spinal cord level, our present observations suggest that the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord may be a site where vertebrate Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-like peptides, and in particular, FLFQPQRFamide, may exert opiate modulating activities.",NA,NA,NA

Acoustic signals recorded on each laser firing can be used to reconstruct a complete 2-D (3-D) image of sources of heat release within that region. Using broad-beam excitation, the maximum frame rate of the imaging system is restricted by the pulse repetition rate of the laser.        An alternate illumination approach is proposed based on fast scanning by a low energy (similar to 1 mJ) high repetition rate (up to a few kHz) narrow laser beam (similar to 1 mm) along the tissue surface over a region of interest. A final PA image is produced from the summation of individual PA images reconstructed at each laser beam position. This concept can take advantage of high repetition rate fiber lasers to create PA images with much higher frame rates than current systems, enabling true real-time integration of photoacoustics with ultrasound imaging. As an initial proof of concept, we compare conventional broad beam illumination to a scanned beam approach in a simple model system.        Two transparent teflon tubes with diameters of 1.6 mm and 0.8 mm were filled with ink having an absorption coefficient of 5 cm(-1). These tubes were buried inside chicken breast tissue acting as an optical scattering medium. They were separated by 3 mm or 10 mm to test spatial and contrast resolution for the two scan formats. The excitation wavelength was 700 nm. The excitation source is a traditional OPO pumped by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with doubler. Photoacoustic images were reconstructed using signals from a small, scanned PVDF transducer acting as an acoustic array. Two different illumination schemes were compared: one was 15 mm x 10 mm in cross section and acted as the broad beam; the other was 5 mm x 2 mm in cross section (15 times smaller than the broad beam case) and was scanned over an area equivalent to broad beam illumination. Multiple images obtained during narrow beam scanning were added together to form one PA image equivalent to the single-shot broad beam one.        Results of the phantom study indicate that PA images formed by narrow beam scanning excitation can be equivalent to one shot broad beam illumination in signal to noise ratio and spatial resolution. Future studies will focus on high repetition-rate laser sources and scan formats appropriate for real-time, integrated deep photoacoustic/ultrasonic imaging.",NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, previous research on Grand Connetable island, a key breeding site for Caribbean seabirds, reported high blood Hg concentrations in several seabirds, reaching the threshold of possible health concern for some species, particularly for the magnificent frigatebird Fregata magnificens. Because frigatebirds are experiencing massive mortality events of chicks caused by a herpesvirus disease that first appeared in 2005, this review further discusses a potential synergistic or additive interaction between food availability and Hg exposure in determining the recurrent disease outbreaks, a topic that has been often neglected in the literature. Here, we (i) summarize already published results from several years of research on this topic and (ii) suggest a potential connection between the occurrence of infectious diseases and cumulative effects of environmental stressors in marine top predators including birds, which clearly deserves further investigations. We also highlight the lack of studies on other sources of local pollution rather than Hg, and the need to take into consideration the cumulative effects of stressors on the health status of organisms, rather than focus on individual stressors or specific contaminants.",NA,NA,NA

POPs concentrations in the brain were measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after administration. Twenty-seven of the individual compounds were detected during at least one of the time-points analyzed.

Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, PFASs were best described by a one compartment model. PFASs displayed relatively slow elimination (Kel) and persisted at high levels in the brain. Lipophilic OCPs and PCBs could be fitted to a 2-compartment model. These showed high levels in the brain relative to the dose administrated as calculated by area under the curve (AUC)/Dose.

Dominant PBDE congeners were BDE47, BDE99, and BDE100, but SCI eaglets also contained low levels of higher brominated congeners. 4-OH-CB187 and 4'-OH- CB202 accounted for 65-100% of Sigma OH-PCB in all BC eaglets, with 4'-OH-CB202 as well as 3'-OH-CB138 and 4-OH-CB146 dominating in SCI eaglets. Ostensibly of biogenic origin, 6'-OH-BDE49 and 6-OH-BDE47 were found in BC nestlings. Only 4'-OH-BDE49 (2.10 ng/g) was found in SCI eaglets. MeO-PBDEs and total hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were not found in any birds, but the polybrominated biphenyl BB101 was detected in southwestern BC samples. This study demonstrates that west coast North American bald eagles contain previously unreported organohalogens, which have the potential to impact the health and survival of these raptors.",NA,NA,NA

High POP concentrations have been associated with age, smoking and consumption of marine mammals. Studies have indicated that exposure to POPs during pregnancy may adversely affect fetal and child development.        To assess geographical differences in diet, lifestyle and environmental contaminant exposure among pregnant women in Greenland, blood samples and questionnaire data were collected from 207 pregnant women in five Greenlandic regions (North, Disco Bay, West, South and East). Blood samples were analyzed for 11 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 5 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 15 perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) and 63 metals.        A trend of higher intake of marine mammals in the East and North regions was reflected by a higher n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio. Participants in the East region tended also to have higher intake of terrestrial species. A significant higher seabird intake was seen for pregnant women in the West region. Significant regional differences were found for blood concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, PFASs and mercury, with higher levels in the North and East regions. PFASs were significantly associated with PCBs and OCPs inmost of the regions. In the North region, PFASs were associated with both selenium and mercury. No significant regional difference was observed for PBDEs.        The regional differences of blood levels of POPs and mercury were related to differences in intake of the traditional food. Compared to earlier reports, decreased levels of legacy POPs, Hg and Pb and perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were observed, but the levels of PFAS congeners perfluorohexane sulfonate and perfluorononanoic acid were sustained. The detection of POPs and heavy metals in maternal blood indicates fetal exposure to these compounds possibly influencing fetal development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Plasma and urine samples were extracted using an ion-pairing method. Perfluoroalkyl compounds were extracted from milk samples using acetonitrile, and extracts were cleaned with graphitized nonporous carbon. All extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean seasonal sum of PFCs (Sigma PFCs) detected in dolphin plasma ranged from 530 to 927 ng/g wet weight. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in concentrations between seasons, suggesting a constant exposure to PFCs. Overall, blubber thickness of dolphins did not correlate with PFC concentrations in plasma, suggesting an absence of PFC sequestration in blubber. Sexually immature calves (age, < 10 years; mean Sigma PFCs, 1,410 +/- 780 ng/ g wet wt) were significantly more contaminated (p < 0.001) than their mothers (mean Sigma PFCs, 366 +/- 351 ng/g wet wt). The reproductive history of females had a significant role in the burden of PFC contamination; PFC concentrations in nulliparous females (females that have not been observed with calves) were significantly greater than those detected in uniparous females (females that have been observed with one calf), suggesting an off-loading of PFCs during or after parturition. To investigate this hypothesis, PFCs were analyzed in milk samples (n = 10; mean Sigma PFCs, 134 +/- 76.1 ng/g wet wt), confirming a maternal transfer of PFCs through lactation in dolphins. Results from the present study showed that young and developing bottlenose dolphins are highly exposed to PFCs.

A total of 240 broiler chicks were randomly distributed into 4 groups with 4 replicates of 15 animals each, as follow: T1 (basal diet only; the control group), T2 (basal diet supplemented with zinc bacitracin), T3 (basal diet with 0.5% of the PFA), T4 (basal diet with 1.0% of the PFA). The addition of 0.5% of the PFA improved live body weight of supplemented birds compared to the control group at 35 and 42 days of age, while the total bacterial count in the environment was reduced when 1.0% of the PFA was used. In addition, intestinal villi height and crypt depth suffered variations during the entire experiment in birds treated with both concentrations of the PFA and zinc bacitracin. Total erythrocyte counts were higher on days 14, 28 and 42 in both treated groups (PFA) compared to the control group, as well as hemoglobin content on days 28 and 42. On the other hand, leukocyte counts were lower on days 14, 28 and 42 due to reduced lymphocyte counts in both PFA treated groups compared to the control group. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were lower in broilers fed with either concentration of PFA on day 14 of life, and the same was observed regarding aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in broiler treated with 0.5% of the PFA. Also, total protein and globulin levels were lower on days 14 and 28 in groups fed with phytogenic compared to the control group. Regarding meat quality, breast meat showed higher red intensity and shear force in groups fed with both concentrations of phytogenic compared to the control group, while weight loss by cooking was lower. Finally, 1.0% of phytogenic showed lower docosadienoic acid (C22:2) content in breast meat. In conclusion, results showed that the use of PFAs based on carvacrol and thymol may be considered an interesting alternative to increase broilers performance, replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters, as well as an interesting alternative to reduce the total bacterial count in the environment of broiler chickens.

Plant bioactive compounds, such as phytochemicals, in poultry diets, are gaining popularity due to their potential antioxidant and anti-microbial activities. Some plant derivatives improve the immune system, reduce the stress response, and exert positive effects on health and performance. The dietary supplementation of cinnamon in poultry feed as a natural feed additive has beneficial impacts on nutrient digestibility, hypocholesterolaemic, blood biochemical profile, gene expression, immunity, and particularly on gut health to alleviate the impact of disease and heat stress by maintaining water and electrolytic balance and feed intake. It is clearly demonstrated that cinnamon can be used as an alternative to antibiotics in the poultry industry offering greater animal health, food safety, and economic aspects of poultry production. The increased bacterial resistance to synthetic antibiotics and consumer awareness about the health and food safety concerns have triggered the ban on the use of antibiotic growth promotors (AGPs) in the poultry industry. This situation encouraged the poultry sector and industry to explore safe alternatives to AGPs and focus on developing more sustainable feed management strategies to improve the intestinal health and growth performance of poultry. Consequently, phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) have emerged as natural alternatives to AGPs and have great potential in the poultry industry. In recent years, cinnamon (one of the most widely used spices) has attracted attention from researchers as a natural product with numerous health benefits for poultry. The essential oils in cinnamon, in particular, are of interest because of their antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and hypocholesterolaemic effects, in addition to their ability to stimulate digestive enzymes in the gut. This review mainly emphasizes the potential impact of cinnamon as a natural feed additive on overall gut health, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemical profile, gene expression, gut microbiota and immune response.",NA,NA,NA

Diet may serve as a tool for modulating animal response to oxidative stress. Within the context of a balanced diet, certain feed additives of plant origin, such as phytogenics, may confer additional cytoprotective effects. As gut health is a prerequisite for animal performance, this work delved into advancing our knowledge on dietary and phytogenic effects on the capacity of the poultry gut to counteract oxidative stress. Study findings showed that a reduction in dietary energy and protein intake by 5% primed important antioxidant responses especially upon phytogenic addition. The new knowledge could assist in devising nutritional management strategies for counteracting oxidative stress.        The reduction in energy and protein dietary levels, whilst preserving the gut health of broilers, is warranted in modern poultry production. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are purported to enhance performance and antioxidant capacity in broilers. However, few studies have assessed PFA effects on a molecular level related to antioxidant response. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of administering two dietary types differing in energy and protein levels (L: 95% and H: 100% of hybrid optimal recommendations) supplemented with or without PFA (-, +) on gene expressions relevant for antioxidant response along the broiler gut. Interactions of diet type with PFA (i.e., treatments L-, L+, H-, H+) were determined for critical antioxidant and cyto-protective genes (i.e., nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway) and for the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the proximal gut. In particular, the overall antioxidant response along the broiler gut was increased upon reduced dietary energy and protein intake (diet type L) and consistently up-regulated by PFA addition. The study results provide a new mechanistic insight of diet and PFA functions with respect to the overall broiler gut antioxidant capacity.",NA,NA,NA

The approach may be used to reduce energy and water use in food production and contribute to the sustainability of the system. Anaerobic digestion and composting are common food waste treatment technologies used to stabilize waste and produce residual materials that can replenish the soil, thus contributing to a circular food system. This approach can only be deemed safe and feasible, however, if food waste is uncontaminated or any contaminants are destroyed during treatment. This review brings together information on several contaminant classes at different stages of the food supply chain, their possible sources, and their fates during composting and digestion. The main aim is to identify factors that could impede the transition towards a safe, reliable and efficient circular food system. We investigated heavy metals, halogenated organic compounds, foodborne pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the food system and their fates during digestion and composting. Production and processing stages were identified as major entry points for these classes of contaminants. Heavy metals and foodborne pathogens pose less risk in a circular system than halogenated organics or antibiotic resistance. Given the diversity of properties among halogenated organic compounds, there is conflicting evidence about their fate during treatment. There are relatively few studies on the fate of ARGs during treatment, and these have produced variable results, indicating a need for more research to clarify their fate in the final products. Repeated land application of contaminated food waste residuals can increase the risk of accumulation and jeopardize the safety of a circular food system. Thus, careful management of the system and research into the fate of the contaminants during treatment is needed.",NA,NA,NA

In this scenario, phytobiotics or phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are widely investigated to evaluate their influence on improving gut health, increasing digestibility, and thereby the growth performance. The present study is a continuity of our experiments on dietary inclusion of Piper betle and Persicaria odorata leaf meal and the first of its kind to evaluate the comparative efficacy of phytobiotics (Piper betle and Persicaria odorata leaf meal), with halquinol and tetracycline in broiler chickens. The current experiment findings indicated that, in comparison with the control group, either of the dietary treatments positively modulated the gut morphology, improved ileal digestibility, maintained the intestinal population of Lactobacillus and reduced the pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium spp., thus improved the growth performance in broiler chickens.

Growth performance, gut morphology, ileal digestibility, and cecal microbiota composition were measured. On day 21, the body weight gain (BWG) was enhanced (p < 0.05) in the broiler chickens fed on phytobiotics (Po8 and Pb4) relative to the NC group, however, on day 42 and in terms of overall growth performance, BWG was enhanced (p < 0.05 in diets (Po8, Pb4, HAL and PC) in comparison with the NC group. Conversely, feed conversion ratio (FCR) was recorded reduced (p < 0.05) in Pb4, Po8, HAL, and PC group in comparison with the NC group. Supplementation of phytobiotics (Po8 and Pb4), HAL and PC, positively improved the gut morphology compared to the NC group. Furthermore, the maximum (p < 0.05) villus height (VH) in duodenum and jejunum was observed in broilers fed on diet Pb4. Supplementation of phytobiotics, HAL and PC, improved (p < 0.05) the digestibility of dry matter (DM) (except for HAL), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and ash compared to the NC group. Dietary supplementation of phytobiotics (Po8 and Pb4), HAL and PC, significantly reduced the E. coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus (except for HAL) counts compared to the NC group. However, supplementation of Pb4 resulted in significantly decreased total anaerobic bacteria and Clostridium spp. counts compared to the NC group. In addition, supplementation of phytobiotics significantly increased the Lactobacillus count compared to HAL, PC, and NC groups.

Methods: The current study was conducted on 400 male Ross 308 chickens divided into five treatment groups, based on a completely randomized design with four replicates of 20 broilers. The control group was not fed any feed additives, whereas the other groups received 100 mg/kg of probiotics (Primalac (R)), 200 mg/kg of hogweed extract, 200 mg/kg of anise extract, and 200 mg/kg of oxytetracycline, respectively. On day 35 of chicken breeding, the immune responses were investigated. At the end of chicken breeding, meat quality was analyzed. Also, the jejunal and ileal contents were investigated in terms of intestinal morphology and microflora.        Results: The findings indicated that the highest immune response belonged to the anise extract treatment. The best meat quality belonged to treatments with hogweed and anise extracts (P< 0.05). Also, the lowest numberof harmful intestinal bacteria belonged to hogweed extract treatment (P < 0.05). Morphological characteristics of the intestine improved under the effects of hogweed and anise extract treatments (P < 0.05).        Conclusions: Therefore, inclusion of 200 mg/kg of hogweed and anise extracts in broiler diet is suggested to improve meat quality, immune responses, and intestinal morphology as well as reduce the number of harmful bacteria in the ileum.",NA,NA,NA

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood.        Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health.        Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention.        Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths.        Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks.        Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale.        Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted.        Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.        Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries.        Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health.        Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.        Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.        Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.",NA,NA,NA

The main scope of the current study was to investigate chemical exposure of humpback whales breeding in the Indian Ocean by providing the first published data on this breeding stock concerning persistent organic pollutants (POPs), namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), DDT and its metabolites (DDTs), chlordane compounds (CHL5), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs). Analyses of stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15 in skin resulted in further insight in their feeding ecology, which was in agreement with a diet focused mainly on low trophic level prey species, such as krill from Antarctica. POPs were measured in all humpback whales in the order of HCB > DDTs > CHLs > HCHs > PCBs > PBDEs > MeO-BDEs. HCB (median: 24 ng g(-1) lw) and DDTs (median: 7.7 ng g(-1) lw) were the predominant compounds in all whale biopsies. Among DDT compounds, p,p'-DDE was the major organohalogenated pollutant, reflecting its long-term accumulation in humpback whales. Significantly lower concentrations of HCB and DDTs were found in females than in males (p < 0.001). Other compounds were similar between the two genders (p > 0.05). Differences in the HCB and DDTs suggested gender-specific transfer of some compounds to the offspring. POP concentrations were lower than previously reported results for humpback whales sampled near the Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting potential influence of their nutritional status and may indicate different exposures of the whales according to their feeding zones. Further investigations are required to assess exposure of southern humpback whales throughout their feeding zones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA

Because the crystallized hydrogel from incineration ash has a lower crystallinity than that from bone powder and calcium carbonate reagent.

Recently we carried out a systematic evaluation of phenylalanine to pentafluorophenylalanine (Phe -> F-5-Phe) mutants for the 35-residue chicken villin headpiece subdomain (c-VHP), the hydrophobic core of which features a cluster of three Phe side chains (residues 6, 10, and 17). Phe -> F5-Phe mutations are interesting because aryl -perfluoroaryl interactions of optimal geometry are intrinsically more favorable than either aryl -aryl or perfluoroaryl -perfluoroaryl interactions, and because perfluoroaryl units are more hydrophobic than are analogous aryl units. Only one mutation, Phe10 -> F-5-Phe, was found to provide enhanced tertiary structural stability relative to the native core (by similar to 1 kcal/mol, according to guanidinium chloride denaturation studies). The NMR structure of this mutant, described here, reveals very little variation in backbone conformation or side chain packing relative to the wild type. Thus, although Phe -> F5-Phe mutations offer the possibility of greater tertiary structural stability from side chain -side chain attraction and/or side chain desolvation, the constraints associated with the native c-VHP fold apparently prevent the modified polypeptide from taking advantage of this possibility. Our findings are important because they complement several studies that have shown that fluorination of saturated side chain carbon atoms can provide enhanced conformational stability.",NA,NA,NA

The genes were mapped to segments of six different bovine chromosomes using a radiation hybrid (RH) cell panel. The gene PPAT, coding for the presumed rate-limiting enzyme of the purine de novo pathway was closely linked to PAICS on BTA6. These, and the other bovine locations i.e. GART at BTAL PFAS at BTA19, ADSL at BTA5, ATIC at BTA2 and ADSS at BTA16, are in agreement with published comparative maps of cattle and man. PAICS and PPAT genes are known to be closely linked in human, rat and chicken. Previously, an expressed sequence fragment of PAICS (Bos taurus corpus luteum, BTCL9) was mapped to BTA13. By isolation and characterization of a BAC clone, we have now identified a PAICS processed pseudogene sequence (psiPAICS) on BTA13. Processed pseudogene sequences of PAICS and other genes of the purine biosynthesis pathway were identified in several mammalian species, indicating that the genes of this pathway have been susceptible to retrotransposition.

Biological properties of the expressed VP2 subunit protein were characterized to aid in the development of genetically engineered diagnostic reagents and vaccines against the vvIVDV. When the VP2 DNA-recombinant bacmid was transfected and propagated in the Sf cells, the cells showed no occlusion formation, which is a positive evidence for the insertion of the VP2 DNA into the polyhedrin gene of the bacmid, whereas the occlusions were observed in the cells infected by the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, a wild baculovirus. The expression of VP2 DNA was identified by strong positive reaction in fluorescent antibody test using chicken anti-IBDV serum.

The ability of these compounds to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway in vitro was examined. Induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), measured as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and porphyrin accumulation were monitored after exposure of chick embryo hepatocytes to three individual HDBP congeners and two HDBP mixtures. All HDBP congeners and mixtures tested caused induction of EROD activity. Induction equivalency factors, calculated as the ratio of the effective concentration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) to induce 10 and 50% of the maximal EROD induction to that of the HDBP congener or mixture ranged from 0.0004 to 0.05. Halogenated dimethyl bipyrroles also caused porphyrin accumulation, which increased with exposure time of the hepatocytes and molar bromine content of the HDBP congener or mixture. Heptacarboxylporphyrin III and corproporphyrinogen III were the most abundant porphyrins observed after an exposure period of 48 h. The individual HDBP congeners and mixtures also inhibited binding of [H-3]TCDD to chicken and mouse AhR. Binding of [H-3]TCDD to chicken AhR was inhibited approximately 20% by tetra- to hexabrominated congeners at concentrations of 20 to 40 muM.; binding to mouse AhR was inhibited 40 to 50% by tri- and tetrabrominated dimethyl bipyrroles (DBPs) at 10 muM. The relative affinity of the hexabrominated DBP congener (vs TCDD) for binding to chicken AhR was estimated to be 0.000017.

To learn more about the processing of the polyprotein and factors affecting the correct assembly of the viral capsid in vitro, different constructs were made using two baculovirus transfer vectors, pFastBac and pAcYM1. Surprisingly, the expression of the capsid proteins gave rise to different types of particles in each system, as observed by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. FastBac expression led to the production of only rigid tubular structures, similar to those described as type I in viral infection. Western blot analysis revealed that these rigid tubules are formed exclusively by VPX. These tubules revealed a hexagonal arrangement of units that are trimer clustered, similar to those observed in IBDV virions. In contrast, pAcYM1 expression led to the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs), flexible tubules, and intermediate assembly products formed by icosahedral caps elongated in tubes, suggesting an aberrant morphogenesis. Processing of VPX to VP2 seems to be a crucial requirement for the proper morphogenesis and assembly of IBDV particles. After immunoelectron microscopy, VPX/VP2 was detected on the surface of tubules and VLPs. We also demonstrated that VP3 is found only on the inner surfaces of VLPs and caps of the tubular structures. In summary, assembly of VLPs requires the internal scaffolding of VP3, which seems to induce the closing of the tubular architecture into VLPs and, thereafter, the subsequent processing of VPX to VP2.

In our study, calphostin C also induced rapid apoptosis in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines ALL-1 (BCR-ABL(+) pre-pre-B ALL), RS4;11 (MLL-AF4(+) pro-B ALL), NALM-6 (pre-B ALL), DAUDI (Burkitt's/B-cell ALL), MOLT-3 (T-ALL), and JURKAT (T-ALL), whereas other potent PKC inhibitors did not. In biochemical studies, calphostin C was discovered to induce rapid calcium mobilization from intracellular stores of ALL cell lines, and its cytotoxicity against ALL cell lines was well correlated with the magnitude of this calcium signal. Calphostin C-induced apoptosis,vas markedly suppressed by BAPTA/AM, a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator as well as NiCl2, an inhibitor of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases. Inhibition of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin dth perfluoreperazine dimadeate (a calmodulin antagonist) or cyclosporin A (a specific inhibitor of calcineurin) also reduced the magnitude of calphostin C-induced apoptosis in ALL cell lines. Calphostin C was capable of inducing calcium mobilization and apoptosis in freshly obtained primary leukemic cells from children with ALL.

Various mixtures were studied with approximate molecular weight ranges of 0.5-8.5, 12-30, 45-100, and 0.5-100 kDa. Mixtures of known composition were studied to evaluate the mixture complexity amenable to electrospray combined with ion/ion reactions to reduce spectral complexity associated with multiple charging. Mixture analysis with at least 40 components of low and medium molecular weight and roughly comparable solution concentrations appears to be straightforward. No matrix effects upon ionization were implicated in the data for the low and medium molecular weight mixtures but bovine albumin appeared to inhibit signals from bovine transferrin and chicken conalbumin in the high molecular weight mix. Furthermore, the presence of abundant low mass-to-charge ions appeared to inhibit signals from high molecular weight proteins (>40 kDa) in the 0.5-100 kDa mix. Such an observation is consistent with dynamic range limitations that can arise from discrimination based on ion space charge effects, although an ionization matrix effect could not be precluded from the data reported here. The results reported here indicate that the limitation to mixture complexity amenable to electrospray mass spectrometry imposed by spectral congestion associated with multiple charging can be significantly reduced via ion/ion reactions. The use of ion/ion reactions can therefore facilitate the study of other factors that can impose limitations to mixture analysis, such as matrix effects upon ionization and differences in ion transmission, accumulation, storage, and detection efficiencies.

Method: DRG cell cultures from 9- to 11-day-old chicken embryos were exposed to emulsified perfluorodecalin (PFD; C10F18; 0.5%, 1% and 10%) or perfluorooctylbromide (PFO; C8F17Br; 0.5%, 1% and 10%). The cells were evaluated under phase-contrast optics after 30 h and 120 h for 0.5 and 1% and after 5 h for 10%. To study the integrity of neuronal cells, immunohistochemical labelling for neurofilaments (NF) and tubulin (TUB) was performed. Results: Concentrations of 0.5% and 1% of PFD or PFO did not change immunohistochemical labelling of DRG cells. Go-cultured macrophages showed a foam cell response, presumably representing ingested PFC. At both concentrations PFD induced a weaker foam cell response than PFO. A concentration of 10% led to the death of DRG cells and macrophages within 5 h. Conclusion: PFC caused a dose-dependent damage of neuronal cells. Go-cultured macrophages developed a foam cell response similar to that observed in vivo after prolonged presence of PFC in the vitreous body. These observations indicate that PFD and PFO may not be suitable for long-term vitreous replacement in vitreoretinal surgery.

Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) arriving via long-range transport have been detected in Arctic wildlife, including seabirds which are considered sentinels of marine ecosystem health. There is evidence that PFAA exposure leads to the disruption of thyroid hormones (THs), such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which play important roles in metabolism, incubation, and thermoregulation in seabirds. Here, we investigated relationships between PFAAs and THs [total T4 (TT4), free T4 (FT4), total T3 (TT3) and free T3 (FT3)] in blood plasma collected from 63 thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) at a colony located in northern Hudson Bay (2016–2018). We then tested if PFAAs and TH levels were related to fitness-associated reproductive traits, such as body mass and hatch dates. PFUdA, PFOS, and PFTrDA were the dominant PFAAs in murre blood, accounting for approximately 77% of ∑PFAA. Females had higher PFAAs than males, possibly due to higher trophic feeding. While FT3 increased with PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFDoA, PFTeDA, ∑PFCA7, and ∑PFAA in murres, TT3 decreased with PFOS, PFDoA, and PFTeDA in males, but not females, suggesting thyroid disruption. TT3 increased with body mass, whereas several long-chain PFAAs were negatively correlated with body mass. Negative relationships between PFNA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, and ∑PFAA with hatch dates may be the result of a disruption in incubation behaviour, resulting in earlier hatch dates. Consequently, TT3 concentrations were highest in males and females in 2018, a year in which PFAAs were lowest and hatch dates were delayed relative to 2017. As an Arctic seabird experiencing several indirect effects of climate change, the interaction of PFAAs on thyroid activity may cause additional stress to murres. © 2022","Export Date: 24 May 2022

The concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models have been developed to predict mixture toxicity. Both models assume no interaction between the components, resulting in an additive mixture effect. In the present study, the embryo toxicity test (OECD TG no. 236) with zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) was performed to investigate whether the toxicity caused by binary, ternary, and quaternary mixtures of organic (Benzo[a]pyrene, perfluorooctanesulfonate, and 3,3´,4,4´,5-pentachlorobiphenyl 126) and inorganic (arsenate) pollutants can be predicted by CA and IA. The acute toxicity and sub-lethal alterations such as lack of blood circulation were investigated. The models estimated the mixture toxicity well and most of the mixtures were additive. However, the binary mixture of PFOS and PCB126 caused a synergistic effect, with almost a ten-fold difference between the observed and predicted LC50-value. For most of the mixtures, the CA model was better in predicting the mixture toxicity than the IA model, which was not expected due to the chemicals’ different modes of action. In addition, some of the mixtures caused sub-lethal effects not observed in the single compound toxicity tests. The mixture of PFOS and BaP caused a division of the yolk and imbalance was caused by the combination of PFOS and As and the ternary mixture of PFOS, As, and BaP. Interestingly, PFOS was part of all three mixtures causing the mixture specific sub-lethal effects. In conclusion, the present study shows that CA and IA are mostly resulting in good estimations of the risks that mixtures with few components are posing.

In this time-course study, we applied a shotgun meta-transcriptomics approach to investigate the impact of a PFA product as well as the commonly used antibiotic, zinc bacitracin either at AGP concentration or therapeutic concentration on the gut microbiome and resistome of broiler chickens raised for 35 days. Over the course of the trial, PFA treatments increased the abundance of Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and resulted in a lower abundance of Escherichia, while the latter group increased significantly in the feces of chickens that received either AGP or AB doses of bacitracin. Tetracycline resistance and aminoglycoside resistance were the predominant antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) classes found, regardless of the treatment. PFA application resulted in a decrease in abundance of ARGs compared to those in the control group and other antibiotic treatment groups.

Here, the relative bioavailability (RBA) of PFASs in foods was determined using an in vivo mouse model. Pork, which had the highest lipid content, exhibited the greatest effect on bioavailability by increasing the RBAs of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) while reducing those of fluorotelomer phosphate diesters (diPAPs). During intestinal digestion of lipids, the bioaccessibility of PFAAs increased due to their greater partition into the stable mixed micelles. However, diPAPs were more likely to partition into the undigested oil phase due to their strong hydrophobicity. Both in vitro incubation and molecular docking results indicated that the PFAAs exhibited stronger binding affinities with mouse blood chylomicrons (CMs) than with diPAPs. Collectively, both lipid digestion in the intestine and the carrier effect of CMs played important roles in modulating the bioavailability of PFASs in food.

After being filtered through the PTFE filter, it was analyzed by LC-MS/MS in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The influencing factors, such as mobile phase, SPE cartridge, filter material, and matrix effect, were investigated. Nosiheptide showed a good linear relationship (R2 ≥ 0.999) within the concentration range from 0.3 μg/L to 20 μg/L under optimized conditions.

Herein, a novel photoelectrochemical immunosensor was built for detecting 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), where the perovskite Bi4TaO8Cl sensitized by 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylicacid (PTCA) was implemented as photoactive material, anti-5hmC antibody was served as target recognition reagent, ZrO2 was used for connecting more modifications, and ferrocene was adopted as signal amplification unit. The prepared nanomaterials of Bi4TaO8Cl, PTCA and ZrO2 were well characterized. The possible mechanism for the improved PEC response of Bi4TaO8Cl sensitized by PTCA was investigated carefully, indicated that the matched energy band facilitated the migration of photogenerated electron. In addition, the possible mechanism for signal amplification caused by ferrocene was investigated, showing that ferrocene acted as electron donor to accelerate electron transfer. Under the optimal condition, the biosensor manifested wide detection range from 0.02 to 100 nM with the low detection limit of 5.2 pM (S/N = 3). Moreover, the applicability of the biosensor was demonstrated by investigating the effect of heavy metal Cd2+ and perfluorooctanoic acid on 5hmC content in the leaves and roots of wheat seedlings, as well as the effect of ALV-J on 5hmC content in chicken serum. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :1

It was determined that perfluoropolyether (PFPE) was uniformly distributed on the surface of the Al NPs with no obvious agglomeration by micro-structure analysis. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), microcomputer automatic cal-orimeter (MAC), and combustion and ignition experiments were performed for varying percentages of PFPE blended with Al NPs to examine the reaction kinetics and combustion performance. It was revealed that the oxidation mechanism of PFPE-functionalized Al NPs at a slow heating rate was regulated by the reaction interface fuel–oxidizer ratio. Due to the enlarged fuel–oxidizer contact surface area, fluorine atoms could adequately decompose the inert alumina shell surrounding the Al NPs, optimizing the combustion process of Al NPs. The analytical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pat-tern results confirmed the existence of aluminum trifluoride in combustion products, providing in-sights into the oxidation mechanism of Al NPs.

In this study, we performed a microbiological and molecular investigation of priority pathogens carrying transferable resistance genes to critical antimicrobials in 1-day-old chickens imported from Brazil to Uruguay. Bacterial identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Sensititre. Antimicrobial resistance genes were sought by PCR, and clonality was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Four multidrug-resistant (MDR) representative strains were sequenced by an Illumina and/or Oxford Nanopore Technologies device. Twenty-eight MDR isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 14), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 11), or Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3). While resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins was due to blaCTX-M-2, blaCTX-M-8, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-55, and blaCMY-2, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was associated with the qnrB19, qnrE1, and qnrB2 genes. Finally, resistance to aminoglycosides and fosfomycin was due to the presence of 16S rRNA methyltransferase rmtG and fosA-type genes, respectively. Short- and long-read genome sequencing of E. cloacae strain ODC_Eclo3 revealed the presence of IncQ/rmtG (pUR-EC3.1; 7,400 bp), IncHI2A/mcr-9.1/blaCTX-M-2 (pUR-EC3.2, ST16 [pMLST; 408,436 bp), and IncN2/qnrB19/aacC3/aph(3')-Ib (pUR-EC3.3) resistance plasmids. Strikingly, the blaCTX-M-2 gene was carried by a novel Tn1696-like composite transposon designated Tn7337. In summary, we report that imported 1-day-old chicks can act as Trojan horses for the hidden spread of WHO critical-priority MDR pathogens harboring mcr-9, rmtG, and extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes in poultry farms, which is a critical issue from a One Health perspective. © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.

An extensive number of emerging contaminants in the environmental matrices result in serious health consequences in animals, humans, and plants, even at trace levels. Therefore, it is of paramount significance to quantify these undesirable pollutants, even at a very low concentration, from the natural environment. Magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) has recently achieved huge attention because of its strong magnetic domain and easy separation through an external magnetic field compared with simple solid-phase extraction. Therefore, MSPE appeared the most promising technique for removing and pre-concentration of emerging pollutants at trace level. Compared to the normal solid-phase extraction, MSPE as magnetic hybrid adsorbents offers the unique advantages of distinct nanomaterials and magnetic hybrid materials. It can exhibit efficient dispersion and rapid recycling when applying to a very complex matrix. This review highlights the possible environmental applications of magnetic hybrid nanoscale materials as effective MSPE sorbents to remediate a diverse range of environmentally toxic pollutants. We believe this study tends to evoke a variety of research thrust that may lead to novel remediation approaches in the forthcoming years. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :12

Aims: To identify characteristics of silicosis cases by focusing on a developing country and evaluate the frequency of and factors related to premature deaths and also reveal preventable causes of premature deaths in silicosis. Study Design: Retrospective cohort. Methods: We reviewed the records of 9769 patients who were diagnosed with occupational diseases in İstanbul Occupational Diseases Hospital between 2006 and 2017. According to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, 1473 silicosis cases were detected. The sociodemographic characteristics, job characteristics, comorbidities, serological, functional, and radiological data, and follow-up time were obtained from the medical records. Mortality data were gathered from The National Death Notification System of Ministry of Health. Results: The study examined 9769 cases diagnosed with an occupational disease, and 15.0% (n = 1473) of them were diagnosed with silicosis. The median age of silicosis patients was 40.0 years, and 26.9% of them were child labor when they started to work in dusty industries. Child labor was mostly seen among dental technicians (57.7%), denim sandblasters (46.4%), and miners (37.0%). In the follow-up period, 26.3% of Teflon sandblasters, 11.1% of coal miners, 8.6% of denim sandblasters had died before their average life expectancy, and the years of loss of life was 26.0 ± 11.6 years all over the group. Premature death was associated with occupation [hazard ratio (Teflon sandblast-ing): 3.93, CI: 1.43-10.78; hazard ratio (marble production): 4.4, CI: 1.02-19.21]; large opacities in posterior anterior chest X-ray [hazard ratio: 2.14, CI: 1.18-3.86]; tuberculosis [hazard ratio: 2.60, CI: 1.42-4.76]; and reduction in forced vital capacity (forced vital capacity% ≤80) during diagnosis [hazard ratio: 4.43, CI: 2.22-8.83]. Conclusion: More than a quarter of silicosis cases are those who start working in dusty industries at an early age. Factors associated with premature death in patients with silicosis are patient occupation, large opacities on chest X-ray, tuberculosis, and pulmonary function loss at diagnosis. © Author(s).","Export Date: 24 May 2022

A total of 880 male one-day-old broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to two dietary treatments, each with 20 replicates and 22 chickens per replicate. A corn-soybean-based diet was fed for 42 days as a control diet without PFA, and a treatment diet containing a blend of Carvacrol, Thymol, Carvone, Methyl salicylate, and Menthol encapsulated (as PFAs) at 65 g/ton of feed. Chickens supplemented with PFA had a 3.6% higher Body Weight Gain (BWG) during the starter phase (0 to 14 days) than those in the control group (25.9 versus 25.0 g/d) and a 2.9% reduced Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) during the same period, compared to the control group (1.34 versus 1.38).

The properties that made PFAS into an industrial success also led to their persistence and bioaccumulation. As PFAS were widely used for many decades their presence is evident globally, and their persistence and potential for toxicity create concern for human, animal and environmental health. Following the precautionary principle, a reduction in human exposure is generally recommended. The most significant source of human exposure to PFAS is dietary intake (food and water) with additional exposure via dust. As PFAS concentrations have been more frequently studied in aquatic food sources, there is less understanding of exposure via terrestrial animals. To further define human exposure via animal products, it is necessary to determine PFAS concentrations and persistence in terrestrial livestock and game species. Studies assessing ambient concentrations of PFAS have noted that, aside from point sources of contamination, there is generally low input of PFAS into terrestrial agricultural food chains. However, livestock and game species may be exposed to PFAS via contaminated water, soil, substrate, air or food, and the contribution of these exposures to PFAS concentrations in food products is less well studied. This review focuses on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAAs) and compiles information from terrestrial livestock and game species as a source of dietary exposure in humans, and discusses toxicokinetics and health effects in animals, while identifying future focus areas. Publications describing the transfer of PFAAs to farmed and hunted animals are scarce, and demonstrate large variability in distribution and elimination. We outline several relatively small, short-term studies in cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. While negative effects have not been noted, the poultry investigations were the only studies to explicitly assess health effects. Comparative information is presented on PFAA concentrations in livestock products and edible tissues of game animals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :17

Aggregates of the involved proteins, independently from their primary sequence, induced neuron membrane permeabilization able to trigger an abnormal Ca2+ influx leading to synaptotoxicity, resulting in reduced expression of synaptic proteins and impaired synaptic transmission. Emerging evidence is now focusing on low‐molecular‐weight pre-fibrillar oligomers (PFOs), which mimic bacterial pore‐forming toxins that form well‐ordered oligo-meric membrane‐spanning pores. At the same time, the neuron membrane composition and its chemical microenvironment seem to play a pivotal role. In fact, the brain of AD patients contains increased fractions of anionic lipids able to favor cationic influx. However, up to now the existence of a specific “common structure” of the toxic aggregate, and a “common mechanism” by which it induces neuronal damage, synaptotoxicity and impaired synaptic transmission, is still an open hy-pothesis.

A total of 250 day-old Cobb broiler chicks were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments with five replicates of 10 birds each in a completely randomized design. Five experimental diets at starting and finishing phases were formulated. Diet 1 was the control with no PFA, diets 2, 3, 4, 5 contained PFA (garlic, turmeric, moringa) at 20gkg-1 diet and blend of the three (at 1:1:1) respectively. Feed intake and body weight gained were determined on weekly basis. There were significant (P&lt;0.05) changes in body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio. Bodyweight gained increased by 16.3 - 22% from Tumeric to moringa. Protein digestibility increased by 5% and 3% in birds fed garlic and the blend respectively while about 4% increase in fat digestibility was observed in birds with PFAs. The PFAs exhibited varied positive influence (P&lt;0.05) on carcass yield, but no difference (P&gt;0.05) was observed in the organ weights of the chickens. The fat deposition was substantially reduced (P&lt;0.05) in birds with PFAs. The blood triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were lower (P&lt;0.05) in groups fed with PFAs. All the PFAs significantly increased the HDL above the value obtained in control. No mortality was recorded throughout the experimentation period. It was concluded that the three PFAs and their mixture used in this study improved the performance, nutrient utilization, and carcass traits of broilers. The overall benefits accrued in birds fed with the blend of the PFAs. While garlic showed a higher anti-lipogenic tendency, moringa had a greater influence on the feed intake and growth of the experimental birds. © 2021. by the authors.

Although adding modifier in mobile phase is generally the simplest way to form anions adducts, the formation of halide adducts ion requires a complex post-column addition strategy since traditional halide ionization enhancement reagents are incompatible with LC systems. To solve this problem, the volatile organochlorine salt tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC) was therefore investigated as a potentially non-corrosive mobile phase modifier that was confirmed to be compatible with both LC and MS systems in this study. When short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain chlorinated paraffins (CPs) were determinated simultaneously by ultra-high performance LC combined with ESI high resolution MS (UPLC-ESI-HRMS), all of them tended to ionize by forming [M+Cl]− ions and exhibited excellent sensitivity with the instrumental detection limits of 1-4 pg/μL. Meanwhile, their sensitivities towards CPs were less dependent on their Cl content with the total relative response factors of 0.8-3.5. The method's utility was demonstrated through determination of CPs in surface soil and chicken muscle samples. This was an effective and practical method to enhance the selectivity for [M + Cl]− ions and improve sensitivity towards CPs with various carbon lengths. Importantly, post-column addition was not required, and thus the analytical procedure was simplified. The method has also improved sensitivity towards some other organohalides and may be generally useful in the determination of challenging organic analytes. © 2021","Cited By :1

MBL (mannose-binding lectin) is part of the innate immune system (IIS), which is the host’s first line defense against pathogens. The IIS functions centrally by identifying pathogen-specific microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) with the help of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Studies have classified mannose-binding lectin (MBL) as one of the PRR molecules which belong to the C-type lectin family. The protective role of MBL lies in its ability to activate the complement system via the lectin pathway and there seems to be a direct link between the chicken’s health status and the MBL concentration in the serum. Several methods have been used to detect the presence, the level and the structure of MBL in chickens such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) among others. The concentration of MBL in the chicken ranges from 0.4 to 35 µg/mL and can be at peak levels at three to nine days at entry of pathogens. The variations observed are known to depend on the bacterial strains, breed and age of the chicken and possibly the feed manipulation strategies. However, when chicken MBL (cMBL) becomes deficient, it can result in malfunctioning of the innate immune system, which can predispose chickens to diseases. This article aimed to discuss the importance and components of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in chickens, its mode of actions, and the different methods used to detect MBL. Therefore, more studies are recommended to explore the causes for low and high cMBL production in chicken breeds and the possible effect of feed manipulation strategies in enhancing cMBL production. © 2021 by the authors.

Little is known, however, about the extent of the transfer of the different PFAS compounds to the eggs, especially for alternative fluorinated compounds. In the present study, we measured legacy and emerging PFAS, including Gen-X, ADONA, and F-53B, in the plasma of prelaying black-legged kittiwake females breeding in Svalbard and the yolk of their eggs. We aimed to (1) describe the contaminant levels and patterns in both females and eggs, and (2) investigate the maternal transfer, that is, biological variables and the relationship between the females and their eggs for each compound. Contamination of both females and eggs were dominated by linPFOS then PFUnA or PFTriA. We notably found 7:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid─a precursor of long-chain carboxylates─in 84% of the egg yolks, and provide the first documented finding of ADONA in wildlife. Emerging compounds were all below the detection limit in female plasma. There was a linear association between females and eggs for most of the PFAS. Analyses of maternal transfer ratios in females and eggs suggest that the transfer is increasing with PFAS carbon chain length, therefore the longest chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were preferentially transferred to the eggs. The mean ∑PFAS in the second-laid eggs was 73% of that in the first-laid eggs. Additional effort on assessing the outcome of maternal transfers on avian development physiology is essential, especially for PFCAs and emerging fluorinated compounds which are under-represented in experimental studies. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Cited By :3

The results showed that thermal degradation or transformation of the target compounds did not occur during boiling and frying of fish. The BA% of individual PBDEs, MeO-PBDEs, and OH-PBDEs were 20–51% for boiled fish, 11–20% for pan-fried fish, 15–77% for steamed egg, and 42–68% for pan-fried egg. Cooking decreased the BA% of all target compounds in fish due to protein denaturation. However, the BA% of OH-PBDEs in pan-fried egg were greater than those in steamed egg. In addition, the substituent groups of CH3O- and OH- did not pose any effects on the BA% of BDE-47 in fish, but OH-group decreased its BA% in egg.

C8 comprises three subunits encoded by individual genes: C8a (alpha chain), C8b (beta chain), and C8g (gamma chain). However, in fish, there have been limited studies on the evolutionary history and systematic function of C8. In the present study, phylogenetic analysis indicated the complete divergence of C8 genes in different fish species. Codon usage bias analysis revealed the evolutionary complexity of C8 genes. Selective pressure analysis found that C8 genes have been affected by negative selection during evolution. Sequence alignment identified the sites that are under selective pressure. The systematic functions of C8 were revealed by gene co-expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses. Notably, gene ontology enrichment analysis suggested that C8 proteins in zebrafish function mainly in the neuroendocrine system. Protein structural comparisons showed that putative functional residues and domains were conserved between the C8 subunits of human and grass carp. A preliminary study on the theoretical interaction between C8a and CD59 was performed according to the simulated protein stereo structure. The first functionally-related site was absent in the simulated conformation of the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) C8a-CD59 protein complex. We speculated that Tyr63 is involved in the functional loss of CD59 binding. The docking of CD59 to four potential sites (Met390, Ser391, Leu392, and Val405) in grass carp C8a was analyzed.

One poorly understood outcome occurs when drops bounce or shatter on impact but leave behind a proportion of the liquid on the surface (designated as pinning). This process is studied via impaction experiments with two hard-to-wet leaf surfaces (fat-hen: Chenopodium album and barnyard grass: Echinochloa crus-galli L. P. Beauv) and one hydrophobic artificial surface (Teflon) using three liquid formulations. RESULTS: Drops that impact upon Teflon underwent pinning shatter events via a well-known mechanism referred to as receding breakup. Drops impacting on leaf surfaces did not undergo receding breakup because the liquid rim was not in direct contact with the leaf surface when it broke into secondary droplets. However, pinning did occur on plant surfaces via a different mechanism, especially when using formulations containing a surfactant. CONCLUSION: Newly developed image analysis and methodology has allowed quantification of the volume fraction pinned to surfaces when drops shatter. The addition of surfactant can increase both the probability of pinning and the pinned volume when drops shatter on fat-hen or Teflon. However, the surfactants studied did not substantially improve the probability of pinning on barnyard grass. The difference in behaviour between the two leaf surfaces and the underlying mechanism is worth further study. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","Cited By :6

We measured FTS use amongst people who inject drugs (PWID) in San Francisco. Methods: Data were from a cross-sectional survey of PWID in 2018, recruited by respondent-driven sampling. Participants were asked about FTS use in the last 12 months. Results: Of 458 PWID surveyed, 45.4% had used an FTS in the last 12 months. FTS use was higher among PWID younger in age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.97 per year, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-0.98), witnessing overdose (AOR 2.40, 95% CI 1.36-4.23), currently owning naloxone (AOR 2.92, 95% CI 1.76-4.87), and receiving overdose training (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04-2.51). FTS use was lower among Black/African Americans (AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.93). Amongst FTS users, 80.2% had a positive result, of whom 43.4% did not change their use of the drug, 26.5% abstained from using it, and 30.1% used a lower dose. Conclusion: Efforts to promote the use of FTS may have reached under half of PWID in San Francisco. Avenues need to be found to increase the role of FTS as a harm reduction approach to prevent overdose, particularly for older and Black/African American PWID. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :3

Herein we report the outcomes of a surgery-based multimodality therapy for these pathologies over an 11-year period. In addition, we present a case that illustrates the surgical challenges that extensive chest wall resection may pose. Methods: Using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons general thoracic surgery database, we have prospectively collected data in our institute on all patients undergoing chest wall resection and reconstruction for primary chest wall sarcomas between June 2008-October 2019. Results: We performed 28 surgical procedures on 25 patients aged 5 to 91 years (median age 33). Eleven tumors were bone- and cartilage-derived and 14 tumors originated from soft tissue elements. Seven patients (7/25, 28%) received neo-adjuvant therapy and 14 patients (14/25, 56%) received adjuvant therapy. The median number of ribs that were resected was 2.5 (range 0 to 6). In 18/28 (64%) of surgeries, additional skeletal or visceral organs were removed, including: diaphragm [1], scapula [2], sternum [2], lung [2], vertebra [1], clavicle [1] and colon [1]. Chest wall reconstruction was deemed necessary in 16/28 (57%) of cases, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Gore-Tex patches was used in 13/28 (46%) of cases and biological flaps where used in 4/28 (14%) of cases. R0, R1 and R2 resection margins were achieved in 19/28 (68%), 9/28 (32%) and 0/28 (0%) of cases, respectively. The median follow up time was 33 months (range 2 to 138). During the study period, disease recurred in 8/25 (32%) of patients. Of these, 3 were re-operated on and are free of disease. At date of last follow up, 5/25 (20%) of patients have died due to their disease and in contrast, 20/25 (80%) were alive with no evidence of disease. Conclusions: Surgery-based multimodality therapy is an effective treatment approach for primary chest wall sarcomas. Resection of additional skeletal or visceral organs and reconstruction with synthetic and/or biological flaps is often required in order to obtain R0 resection margins. Ultimately, long-term survival in this clinical scenario is an achievable goal. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cited By :3

Material and methods: The study included 80 pregnant women. Internal consistency was tested using Cronbach's alpha. Questionnaires were applied three different times in order to assess for sensitivity. Patients were asked to complete the questionnaire first in the third trimester, secondly in postpartum 6th week and finally in postpartum 6th month after birth. For translation process content, face/content validity, reliability, construct validity and reactivity studies were done. All women had undergone pelvic examination and prolapse was assessed by using Pelvic organ Prolapse Quantification System (POP-Q). Urinary symptoms were also evaluated with Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) questionnaire. Results: The mean age of patients was 27.7 ± 5.5 years. Forty-one (51.25%) of the patients had vaginal delivery and 39 (48.75%) had a cesarean section. Above 96% of the patients had completed the questionnaires. POP-Q assessments and UDI-6 results were used to evaluate construct validity. Cronbach's alpha results were found to be 0.7 for all the subscales of the questionnaire: bladder: 0.702, bowel: 0.744, prolapse: 0.701, sexual function: 0.706 respectively, indicating adequate reliability. The test/retest reliability was studied and Pabak values showed moderate reliability in the bowel, prolapse and sexuality, and good reliability for bladder subscale. The results of the patients were compared between pregnancy and postpartum to assess reactivity and shown to be reactive to changes. Also risk factors of the patients were assessed including, family predisposition, maternal age over 35 years, BMI > 25, nicotine use, subjective inability to contract pelvic floor and sense of postpartum wound pain. Conclusions: The Turkish version of APFDQ is a reliable and valid tool. It can be used for assessing the risk factors, incidence, assessing degree of PFDs and evaluating the impact on quality of life in pregnant and postpartum women. © 2020 Via Medica.","Cited By :1

This transfer has a strong influence on developmental disorders and even breeding success. With this in mind polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo furans (PCDD/Fs), as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were analyzed in the eggs of aquatic birds from different habitats and with different diet preferences. The highest concentration of PBDE was noted in gull eggs (198.31 ng g−1 dw.) and the lowest in tern eggs (sandwich tern: 76.96 ng g−1 dw.; common tern: 113.73 ng g−1 dw). Deca-BDE was detected only in herring gull eggs from the Wloclawek reservoir. PCDDF/s were found in the eggs of terns from the southern coast of the Baltic Sea and gulls from an inland reservoir (dam) on the River Vistula close to the town of Wloclawek.

There is a growing interest in the identification of small molecules that can prevent proteins from undergoing amyloid fibril formation. In the present study, a series of small aromatic compounds with different substitutions of 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene have been synthesized and their possible effects on amyloid fibril formation by hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), a model protein for amyloid formation, and of their resulting toxicity were examined. The inhibitory effect of the compounds against HEWL amyloid formation was analyzed using thioflavin T and Congo red binding assays, atomic force microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and cytotoxicity assays, such as the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) reduction assay and caspase-3 activity measurements. We found that all compounds in our screen were efficient inhibitors of HEWL fibril formation and their associated toxicity. We showed that electron-withdrawing substituents such as –F and –NO2 potentiated the inhibitory potential of 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene, whereas electron-donating groups such as –OH, –OCH3, and –CH3 lowered it. These results may ultimately find applications in the development of potential inhibitors against amyloid fibril formation and its biologically adverse effects. © 2019 by the authors.

By integrating the space-confined alloying and surface engineering strategies, we demonstrate a new class of core-shell structured PtFe@PtRuFe nanocatalyst, composed of an ordered PtFe intermetallic core with a 3–5 atomic-layers-thick PtRuFe shell. The well-defined PtFe@PtRuFe core-shell nanostructure exhibits excellent anti-CO poisoning ability and resistance to Fe leaching, achieving a factor of 1.68 enhancement in mass activity and a factor of 1.57 improvement in specific activity toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) compared to the state-of-the-art PtRu/C catalysts. Furthermore, the CO anodic oxidation on the PtFe@PtRuFe catalyst surface (0.39 V) starts much earlier than on the commercial PtRu/C (0.43 V) and Pt/C (0.83 V) catalysts. The enhanced MOR activity and anti-CO poisoning ability of the PtFe@PtRuFe catalyst is mainly attributed to the well-defined core-shell structure and favorable composition as well as the charge transfer from Fe/Ru to Pt and thusly be weakened Pt-COads adsorption energy.

To advance the capabilities of CEUS, the synthesis and understanding of new ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) is a necessity. Many UCAs are nano- or micro-scale materials composed of a perfluorocarbon (PFC) and stabilizer that synergistically induce an ultrasound response that is both information-rich and easily differentiated from natural tissue. In this work, we probe the extent to which CEUS is modulated through variation in a PFC stabilized with fluorine-modified polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs). The high level of synthetic tunability in this system allows us to study signal as a function of particle aggregation and PFC volatility in a systematic manner. Separation of aggregated and non-aggregated nanoparticles lead to a fundamentally different signal response, and for this system, PFC volatility has little effect on CEUS intensity despite a range of over 50 °C in boiling point. To further explore the imaging tunability and multimodality, Fe3+-chelation was employed to generate an enhanced photoacoustic (PA) signal in addition to the US signal. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PFC-loaded PDA NPs show stronger PA signal than the non-PFC ones, indicating that the PA signal can be used for in situ differentiation between PFC-loading levels. In sum, these data evince the rich role synthetic chemistry can play in guiding new directions of development for UCAs. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Cited By :7

Given their wide distribution in the environment and the fact that bisphenol-A (BPA), methylparaben (MP), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are uniformly detected in unselected body fluid samples, it must be assumed that humans are simultaneously exposed to these chemicals almost daily. We studied the effects of a ternary mixture of BPA, MP, and PFOA on benign breast epithelial cells at the range of concentrations observed for single chemicals in human samples. Measurements of exposure impact relevant to the breast were based on endpoints associated with ""hallmarks"" of cancer and ""key characteristics"" of carcinogens. These included modulation of total estrogen receptor (ER)α, phosphorylated ERα (pERα), total ERβ, S-phase induction, and apoptotic evasion. Data from live cell measurements were fit to a log-linear dose-response model. Concentration-dependent reduction of ERβ and apoptosis evasion was observed concurrently with the induction of ERα, pERα, and S-phase fraction, and an increased rate of cell proliferation. Beyond additive effects predicted by the sum of individual test XEs, mixture treatment demonstrated synergism for the ERβ and apoptosis suppression phenotypes (p > .001). Nonmalignant breast cells were more sensitive than commonly used breast cancer lines to XE treatment in 3 of 5 endpoints.

Objectives: To investigate the clinical characteristics and possible risk factors of PFAS in Turkey, and to evaluate if there was an association between skin test reactivity to pollens and presence of PFAS. Methods: A total of 254 consecutive adult patients with pollen sensitivity were prospectively recruited. Patients were interviewed with a questionnaire including a list of pollen-associated foods. Patients were classified as having PFAS if they reported clear allergic symptoms compatible with PFAS. All participants underwent skin prick tests (SPT) to a panel of common aeroallergens, prick-to-prick tests with culprit fresh foods were performed in patients who gave consent. Results: Self-reported PFAS was observed in 49 patients (19.3%). The most common culprit foods were kiwi, peach, tomato, melon and watermelon. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that potential risk factors for PFAS were having asthma (OR=2.392, P=0.044) and tree pollen sensitization (OR=2.904, P=0.004). There were no significant differences in the SPT wheal sizes to individual pollen extracts between patients with and without PFAS with a positive SPT result for that pollen extract (P>0.05). Conclusions: PFAS is frequent in pollen sensitized adults in Turkey. The most commonly implicated foods are kiwi, peach,tomato, melon and watermelon, in our geographical region.

In this work, the relationship between copper potentially present during food elaboration and Nε-(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine (CML) concentrations, has been examined for the first time. For CML determination, a reversed phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry procedure, based on acid hydrolysis, ethyl chloroformate derivatization and quantification in MRM mode was set-up, yielding method quantification limit of 98 µg kg−1; copper was determined by ICP-MS. For eleven commercial cheeses, CML and Cu were found in the ranges 3.70–8.58 µg g−1 and 0.08–15.5 µg g−1, respectively, suggesting an inverse relation between these two parameters. For beef, chicken, Mexican pork “carnitas” and salmon, the CML concentration was lower in the item cooked in Cu casserole while element concentration was increased, as compared to this same raw material prepared in Teflon™ (except for “carnitas”). Concentration-dependent effect of Cu, manifest by decreased CML formation, was confirmed evaluating conversion percentage of chemically protected lysine (ZLys) to ZCML in the absence and in the presence of different Cu concentrations (50.0% and 20.4% conversion for Cu:ZLys molar ratio 0:1 and 0.04:1, respectively). Consistent results obtained in the analysis of three different sample types point to the inhibitory effect of copper during CML formation; however, it should be stressed that Cu is only one parameter within a complex set of factors/conditions involved in glycation process. Although better understanding of the observed effect at molecular level is needed, the results obtained in this work strongly suggest beneficial effect of copper, inhibiting glycation process during food elaboration. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Cited By :5

The experimentally determined Gibbs activation energy for the addition of C6F6 to a Mg-Mg bond of a molecular complex, ΔG‡298 K(experiment) = 21.3 kcal mol-1 is modelled by DFT with the ωB97X functional, ΔG‡298 K(DFT) = 25.7 kcal mol-1. The transition state for C-F activation involves a polarisation of the Mg-Mg bond and significant negative charge localisation on the fluoroarene moiety. This transition state is augmented by stabilising closed-shell Mg⋯Fortho interactions that, in combination with the known trends in C-F and C-M bond strengths in fluoroarenes, provide an explanation for the experimentally determined preference for C-F bond activation to occur at sites flanked by ortho-fluorine atoms. The effect of modification of both the ligand coordination sphere and the nature and polarity of the M-M bond (M = Mg, Zn, Al) on C-F activation has been investigated. A series of highly novel β-diketiminate stabilised complexes containing Zn-Mg, Zn-Zn-Zn, Zn-Al and Mg-Al bonds has been prepared, including the first crystallographic characterisation of a Mg-Al bond. Reactions of these new M-M containing complexes with perfluoroarenes were conducted and modelled by DFT. C-F bond activation is dictated by the steric accessibility, and not the polarity, of the M-M bond. The more open coordination complexes lead to enhanced Mg⋯Fortho interactions which in turn lower the energy of the transition states for C-F bond activation. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Cited By :49

Adsorption process has been proven as an effective treatment being activated carbon as the adsorbent to remove many types of pollutant including low concentration of pollutants. However, on large scale industrial processes, utilisation of activated carbon is limited because of their high production cost. Synthesis of waste materials as a precursor of adsorbent is an attractive approach in sustainable management and economic availability. In this study, the removal of ACT from aqueous solution by chemically treated chicken bone (AC) waste was investigated. The adsorption process was conducted in a batch adsorption and affected by several experimental parameters including contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, initial concentration and temperature. With AC dosage of 0.1 g about 93 % of 1,000 mg/L ACT was removed from the aqueous solution that had pH of 2 and temperature of 25 °C. Kinetic of ACT adsorption was well described by pseudo-second order kinetic model. Meanwhile, effect of initial concentration of acetaminophen adsorption data was fitted well with Freundlich isotherm model with an R2 of 0.9909. Finally, the data obtained from effect of temperature was used to determine the adsorption thermodynamic including the enthalpy, ΔH, Gibbs energy, ΔG and entropy, ΔS. It was found that the ΔG was negative at all temperature while both, ΔH and ΔS was also negative between temperatures of 25 °C to 70 °C indicating the process of ACT adsorption was exothermic reaction and the adsorption reaction is spontaneous at low temperature.

Animal studies have shown that PFAAs have immunotoxic effects. However, few epidemiological studies have investigated the effects of PFAAs on infectious diseases occurrence. We examined the relationship between prenatal exposure to PFAAs and prevalence of infectious diseases up to 4 years of life. A total of 1558 mother-child pairs, who were enrolled in the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health, were included in this data analysis. Eleven PFAAs were measured in maternal plasma taken at 28–32 weeks of gestation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Participant characteristics were obtained from medical birth records and self-administered questionnaires during pregnancy and after delivery. Physicians' diagnosis of common infectious diseases including otitis media, pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and varicella up to 4 years were extracted from the mother-reported questionnaires. The number of children who developed infectious diseases up to 4 years of age was as follows: otitis media, 649 (41.4%); pneumonia, 287 (18.4%); respiratory syncytial virus infection, 197 (12.6%); varicella 589 (37.8%). A total of 1046 (67.1%) children had at least one of the diseases defined as total infectious diseases. After adjusting for appropriate confounders, PFOS levels in the highest quartile were associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) of total infectious diseases (Q4 vs. Q1 OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.21; p for trend = 0.008) in all children. In addition, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) was associated with a higher risk of total infectious diseases only among girls (Q4 vs. Q1 OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 0.976, 2.45; p for trend = 0.045). We found no association between infectious diseases and other examined PFAAs. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFHxS may associated with infectious diseases occurrence in early life. Therefore, prenatal exposure to PFAAs may be immunotoxic for the immune system in offspring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :41

Extracellular vesicles shed by solid tumors into the bloodstream have been under recent investigation as a source of tumor-derived biomarkers such as proteins and nucleic acids. We report here an approach using submicrometer perfluorobutane nanodroplets and focused ultrasound to enhance the release of extracellular vesicles from specific locations in tumors into the blood. The released extracellular vesicles were enumerated and characterized using micro flow cytometry. Only in the presence of nanodroplets could ultrasound release appreciable levels of tumor-derived vesicles into the blood. Sonication of HT1080-GFP tumors did not increase the number of circulating tumor cells or the metastatic burden in the tumor-bearing embryos. A variety of biological molecules were successfully detected in tumor-derived extracellular vesicles, including cancer-associated proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs. Sonication of xenograft HT1080 fibrosarcoma tumors released extracellular vesicles that contained detectable RAC1 mRNA with the highly tumorigenic N92I mutation known to exist in HT1080 cells. Deep sequencing serum samples of embryos with sonicated tumors allowed the identification of an additional 13 known heterozygous mutations in HT1080 cells. Applying ultrasound to HT1080 tumors increased tumor-derived DNA in the serum by two orders of magnitude. This work is the first demonstration of enhanced extracellular vesicle release by ultrasound stimulation and suggests that nanodroplets/ultrasound offers promise for genetic profiling of tumor phenotype and aggressiveness by stimulating the release of extracellular vesicles. ©2016 AACR.","Cited By :14

Certain PFAS are regulated or voluntarily limited due to concern about environmental persistence and adverse health effects, including thyroid disease and dyslipidemia. The major source of PFAS exposure in the general population is thought to be consumption of seafood. Objectives In this analysis we examine PFAS levels and their determinants, as well as associations between PFAS levels and self-reported fish and shellfish consumption, using a representative sample of the U.S. population. Methods Data on PFAS levels and self-reported fish consumption over the past 30 days were collected from the 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Twelve different PFAS were measured in serum samples from participants. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to identify factors (demographic characteristics and fish consumption habits) associated with serum PFAS concentrations. Additional models were further adjusted for other potential exposures including military service and consumption of ready-to-eat and fast foods. Results Seven PFAS were detected in at least 30% of participants and were examined in subsequent analyses (PFDA, PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, MPAH, PFNA, PFUA). The PFAS with the highest concentrations were PFOS, followed by PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA (medians of 8.3, 2.7, 1.5 and 1.0 ng/mL). Fish consumption was generally low, with a median of 1.2 fish meals and 0.14 shellfish meals, reported over the past 30 days. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, total fish consumption was associated with reduced MPAH, and with elevated PFDE, PFNA and PFuDA. Shellfish consumption was associated with elevations of all PFAS examined except MPAH. Certain specific fish and shellfish types were also associated with specific PFAS. Adjustment for additional exposure variables resulted in little to no change in effect estimates for seafood variables. Conclusions PFAS are emerging contaminants with widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects. In the general population, fish and shellfish consumption are associated with PFAS levels, which may indicate an avenue for education and outreach. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cited By :71

PFPE substrates were synthesized by the photocuring of liquid PFPE urethane dimethacrylate. These surfaces were then modified by ECM protein coatings and microstructuration, to promote cell adhesion and migration. The surface properties of PFPE and PDMS (used as a reference) samples were studied by static contact angle measurements and AFM imaging. Both polymer surfaces were hydrophobic, having sessile air-water contact angles superior to 100°. Collagen and fibronectin coatings were found to change the wettability of PFPE and PDMS samples. The biological testing of substrates was done using a liver organotypic culture to evaluate the migration and density of liver cells. The results over seven days of culture demonstrated that the migration and density of cells cultured under untreated PFPE were higher than the migration and density of cells cultured under PDMS. ECM protein coatings enhanced cell migration from liver explants cultured on PFPE or PDMS. Furthermore, these coatings were more efficient in the case of a PFPE sample. From a second series of tests, in which the PFPE was microstructured, it was found that microstructures promoted the formation of a 3D cell layer. These results indicate that PFPE polymers have a potential for use in the development of biomaterials for tissue engineering and cell culture. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Cited By :10

The solid surface tensions of silver ink on glass and polytetrofluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates were determined theoretically, knowing characteristics of droplet. Meanwhile, a Dimatix printer with nozzles of size of 21.5 μm was used to print conductive lines on smooth glass and PTFE substrates. The printed lines on glass were observed to be continuous with high quality of triple line, which was attributed to the high solid surface tensions of silver nanofluid ink on glass substrates. The solid surface tensions of silver nanofluid ink were relatively low on PTFE, as results the printed lines were discontinuous. The solid surface tensions were introduced as a reliable criterion to predict the printability of nanofluids. The distribution of silver nanoparticles and layering phenomenon in silver nanofluid triple region on glass substrate was clearly observed, using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) for the first time.

Objectives: We sought to describe PFAS serum concentrations' temporal trends among Gullah African American residents of coastal South Carolina. Methods: Longitudinal measures of PFAS in blood serum from a Gullah clinical sample, without lupus, were examined using spaghetti plots and visit-to-visit change scores (e.g., differences in concentrations between visits) among the 68 participants with repeated measures available. We also modeled population-level trends among the 71 participants with any data using proportionate percentile models, accounting for clustering through robust standard errors. In a post-hoc analysis we examined heterogeneity of temporal trends by age through mixed-effects models for the log-transformed PFAS compounds. Results: Population concentrations of PFOS dropped approximately 9 (95% CI: 8, 10) percent each year over 2003-2013. This was concordant with individual PFOS trajectories (median PFOS change score -21.7 ng/g wet weight, interquartile range of PFOS change scores: -32.8, -14.9) and reports for other populations over this time period. Several other compounds including PFOA, PFHxS, and PFuNDA also showed a population-level decrease. However, examination of individual trajectories suggested substantial heterogeneity. Post-hoc analyses indicated that PFAS trajectories were heterogeneous by age. Conclusions: Many PFAS compounds are decreasing in a sample of Gullah African Americans from coastal South Carolina. There may be age differences in the elimination kinetics of PFASs. The possible role of age as a modifier of PFAS serum trends merits further research. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cited By :26

We recently designed and synthesized a new class of compounds, consisting of both tetrafluorinated thalidomide analogues (Gu973 and Gu998) and tetrafluorobenzamides (Gu1029 and Gu992). In this study, we demonstrate the antiangiogenic properties of these newly synthesized compounds. We examined the specific antiangiogenic characteristics in vitro using rat aortic rings with carboxyamidotriazole as a positive control. In addition, further in vitro efficacy was evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and PC3 cells treated with 5 and 10 mmol/L doses of each compound. All compounds were seen to reduce microvessel outgrowth in rat aortic rings as well as to inhibit HUVECs to a greater extent, at lower concentrations than previously tested thalidomide analogs. The antiangiogenic properties of the compounds were also examined in vivo in fli1:EGFP zebrafish embryos, where all compounds were seen to inhibit the extent of outgrowth of newly developing blood vessels. In addition, Gu1029 and Gu973 reduced the anti-inflammatory response in mpo:GFP zebrafish embryos, whereas Gu998 and Gu992 showed no difference. The compounds' antitumor effects were also explored in vivo using the human prostate cancer PC3 xenograft model. All four compounds were also screened in vivo in chicken embryos to investigate their teratogenic potential.

Transferrin and lysozyme were used to evaluate the recoveries of proteins from dedicated reversed-phase columns. Different types of reversed-phase columns were evaluated, such as core shell type materials (Aeris Widepore with C4, C8 and C18 modification) as well as fully porous hybrid particles (Waters BEH, modified with C4 and C18 alkyl chains). Recoveries ranged between 60.7-95.2% for transferrin and 72.1-99.8% for lysozyme. Based on the data presented, at least two different adsorption effects, thewellknown hydrophobic and silanophilic/polar interaction might influence the recovery. In addition to this, conformational effects due to ion pairing with the acidic mobile phase additive might change them. © 2014 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press.

Yet, the extent to which motor skill acquisition relies on intrinsic spinal cord processes remains unknown. To date, attempts to address this question were limited by difficulties in separating spinal local effects from supraspinal influences through traditional electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods. Here, for the first time, we provide evidence for local learning-induced plasticity in intact human spinal cord through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord during motor sequence learning. Specifically, we show learningrelated modulation of activity in the C6–C8 spinal region, which is independent from that of related supraspinal sensorimotor structures. Moreover, a brain–spinal cord functional connectivity analysis demonstrates that the initial linear relationship between the spinal cord and sensorimotor cortex gradually fades away over the course of motor sequence learning, while the connectivity between spinal activity and cerebellum gains strength. These data suggest that the spinal cord not only constitutes an active functional component of the human motor learning network but also contributes distinctively from the brain to the learning process. The present findings open new avenues for rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries, as they demonstrate that this part of the central nervous system is much more plastic than assumed before. Yet, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this intrinsic functional plasticity in the spinal cord warrant further investigations. © 2015 Vahdat et al.","Cited By :47

With new anthropogenic compounds continuously introduced to the environment, novel and proactive approaches that provide a comprehensive alternative to targeted methods are needed in order to more completely characterize the diversity of known and unknown compounds likely to cause adverse effects. Nontargeted mass spectrometry attempts to extensively screen for compounds, providing a feasible approach for identifying contaminants that warrant future monitoring. We employed a nontargeted analytical method using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-offlight mass spectrometry (GC×GC/TOF-MS) to characterize halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) in California Black skimmer (Rynchops niger) eggs. Our study identified 111 HOCs; 84 of these compounds were regularly detected via targeted approaches, while 27 were classified as typically unmonitored or unknown. Typically unmonitored compounds of note in bird eggs included tris(4-chlorophenyl)methane (TCPM), tris(4-chlorophenyl) methanol (TCPMOH), triclosan, permethrin, heptachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP), as well as four halogenated unknown compounds that could not be identified through database searching or the literature. The presence of these compounds in Black skimmer eggs suggests they are persistent, bioaccumulative, potentially biomagnifying, and maternally transferring. Our results highlight the utility and importance of employing nontargeted analytical tools to assess true contaminant burdens in organisms, as well as to demonstrate the value in using environmental sentinels to proactively identify novel contaminants. © 2015 Millow et al.","Cited By :27

These two contact angles have been found to be linearly related with a slope close to 1. However, the underwater contact angles have been found to deviate significantly from the prediction based on Young's equations which have been attributed to the possible modifications of the surfaces underwater due to adsorption of surfactants. Based on the observed oil underwater contact angles, comparative efficiencies of fatliquoring have been obtained.

Physicians reported monthly aggregated data on all varicella cases and case-based on vaccinated patients, of whom skin lesion samples were laboratory investigated to identify varicella-zoster virus (VZV). We analyzed the impact of vaccination frequency on the number of cases and on laboratory results within the sentinel. Methods: Swabs were obtained with a Teflon tip and sent together with a case-based questionnaire to the reference laboratory. VZV wild-type and vaccine-type was identified by polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and pyrosequencing methods. Case-based data and laboratory results were analyzed descriptively. Results: From April 2005 to March 2014, of all monthly reported cases (n=111,456) 4789 were vaccinated and eligible for further analysis. No differences were found between laboratory investigated and not investigated cases (1017 vs. 3772) except that the proportion of cases vaccinated twice was higher in lab-cases (29.4% vs. 16.1%). PCR remained negative in 69.6% (197/283) of breakthrough-cases vaccinated twice, in comparison to 22.7% (147/649) breakthrough-cases vaccinated once. VZV was confirmed in 500 (81) patients with breakthrough varicella after one (two) vaccination(s); identification of VZV wild-type, vaccine-type, or no further differentiation was possible in 485 (72), 5 (6), and 10 (3) cases, respectively. Conclusion: Varicella breakthrough disease is rare in Germany and suspected clinical cases require laboratory confirmation. The lower confirmation rate of VZV after two vaccine doses suggests a better protection compared to one dose. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cited By :3

In Norway, pre-eclampsia is reported in 3 to 4 per cent of registered births. At present, November 2014, a series of investigations into the etiology of preeclampsia have been published internationally from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), and several studies are ongoing. The intention of this paper is to give a short summary of what has been accomplished, and to discuss future avenues of research concerning causes, mechanisms and consequences of pre-eclampsia. The papers that have been published up to now include seven that concern life-styles (physical activity, tobacco and diet), six that include prior pregnancies, infection, gestational weight gain, toxicants and tryptophan metabolism, and two studies concerning issues of selection and validity. Major findings are that tobacco smoking is only associated with reduced risk of pre-eclampsia when it occurs in the last trimester; that processed food and sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with increased risk while vegetables, vitamin D and probiotics are associated with reduced risk; and that prior induced abortions have the same risk-reducing effect as a prior pregnancy. For future studies, we suggest that better use should be made of the family structure built into MoBa. This includes better use of the discordant pregnancy design. A series of ongoing genetic studies, partly in international consortia, will hopefully open new etiological insights. The indications that pre-eclampsia is related to cardiovascular disease and other complex disorders should be further investigated through systematic follow-up of pre-eclamptic women and controls. Finally, MoBa is eminently suited to study the influences that pre-eclampsia can have on the growing child. © 2014, Norwegian Epidemiological Society. All rights reserved.","Cited By :6

Currently, there is no approved therapeutic agent for inhibition of fibrillar assemblies. One important approach in the development of therapeutic agents is the use of herbal extracts. At the present comparative study, the effect of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Nees and Camellia sinensis L, extracts on prevention of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) amyloidogenesis were studied. Methods: In this experimental study, acidic pH and high temperature were used to drive the protein towards amyloid formation. Lysozyme was dissolved at 2 mg/mL in 50mM glycine buffer (pH 2.5), and then incubated at 57 °C for a specified time while stirred gently by Teflon magnetic bars. Measurement of thioflavin T fluorescence intensity and AFM micrography were used to characterize the HEWL fibrillation processes. Data were analyzed through SPSS 16 using descriptive statistics as well as independent t-test. Results: In the absence of the extracts, soluble oligomers became evident after 24 h of incubation, followed by subsequent appearance of mature fibrils after 48h. Upon incubation with various concentrations of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Camellia sinensis extracts in range of 0.1-1 mg/ml, formation of fibrillar assemblies were dose-dependently inhibited but the extract of Camellia was more efficient (P=0.025). Also, in contrast to Cinnamomum, Camellia extract can stabilize native protein and reverse partial unfolded form into native form and thus, can inhibit all of amyloid formation pathways. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that poly phenols of the extracts directly insert into amyloidogenic core of early aggregates and inhibit amyloid fibril formation but Camellia extract, due to its specific chemical structure, is probably more effective for aggregation inhibition.","Cited By :3

The authors examined the maternal transfer, potential metabolism, and tissue distribution of several halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) during egg formation and chicken embryo development. The pollutant composition changes significantly from hen muscle to eggs and from eggs to tissues of newborn chicks. Higher-halogenated chemicals, such as octa- to deca-polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, deca-polybrominated biphenyl (PBB209), and dechlorane plus (DP), are less readily transferred to eggs compared with lower-halogenated chemicals. During embryo development, PBDEs are the most likely to be metabolized, whereas decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) is the least. The authors also observed selective maternal transfer of anti-DP and stereoselective metabolism of syn-DP during chicken embryo development. During tissue development, liver has greater affinity than the muscle for chemcials with a high log octanol-water partition coefficient, with the exception of DBDPE. The differences in metabolism potential of different chemicals in chicken embryos cause pollutant composition alterations. Halogenated flame retardant from maternal transfer and tissue distribution also exhibited chemical specificity, especially for DBDPE. Levels of DBDPE were elevated along with the full process from hen muscle to eggs and from eggs to chick tissues. More attention should be paid to the selective accumulation and biotransformation of HFRs in the early development stage of birds. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:1712-1719. © 2014 SETAC.","Cited By :30

In this study, these parameters were analysed and related to levels of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs) in 40 Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) chicks. Chicks were experimentally exposed to HOCs through diet and went through a period of nutrient deprivation at the end of the experiment. HOC exposure and fasting were conducted separately and in combination. NL storages were depleted, and lysosomal membranes were destabilised after HOC exposure and nutrient deprivation. These responses were not related specifically to one type of stress or the extent of the treatment. No synergistic or additive effects from the combination of HOC exposure and fasting were observed. LF accumulated, and MDA levels increased as a result of fasting, but were unaffected by HOC exposure. LF accumulation was strongly associated with the percent weight change in the chicks. Large weight loss was associated with high LF levels, and slight weight gain was associated with low LF levels. Hence, food deprivation affected all the measured parameters, and HOC exposure decreased NL levels and lysosomal membrane stability in HG chick liver. Furthermore, autophagic lysosomal parameters have frequently been applied as biomarkers of cellular health status in previous studies of marine and terrestrial invertebrates, and this study suggests that these parameters may be good candidates for biomarkers of cellular health status in seabirds as well. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To clarify the effects of maternal Mn exposure on epigenetic gene regulation contributing to the sustained disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis, we treated pregnant ICR mice with MnCl2 in diet from gestational day 10 through day 21 after delivery on weaning and searched epigenetically downregulated genes by global promoter methylation analysis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of male offspring on postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND 77. By CpG promoter microarray analysis on PND 21 following 800-ppm Mn exposure, sustained promoter hypermethylation and transcript downregulation through PND 77 were confirmed with Mid1, Atp1a3, and Nr2f1, whereas Pvalb showed a transient hypermethylation only on weaning. The numbers of Pvalb+ and ATP1a3+ neurons suggestive of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons, Mid1+ cells suggestive of late-stage granule cell lineage and GABAergic interneurons, and COUP-TF1+ cells suggestive of early-stage granule cell lineage were all reduced on PND 21, and reductions were sustained on PND 77 except for no change in Pvalb+ cells. Mid1+ cells showed asymmetric distribution with right-side predominance, and Mn exposure abolished it by promoter hypermethylation of the right side. These findings indicate epigenetic mechanisms as mediators, through which Mn exposure modulates neurogenesis involving both granule cell lineage and GABAergic interneurons with long-lasting and stable repercussions. Disruption of asymmetric cellular distribution of Mid1 suggests that higher brain functions specialized in the left or right side of the brain were affected. © The Author 2013.

We proposed to describe the relationship between AHLs and β-galactosidase of AHL biosensor with an equation. The equation could fit the β-galactosidase data well with a high determination coefficient (0.994) and low root mean squared error (0.016). In all experiment, there was no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) between the observed and calculated AHL values in chicken meat, when different type of AHLs was used. Hence, based on the equation the AHLs similar to Pseudomonasaeruginosa production can be calculated. This approach simplified the calculation of the AHL production in chicken meat and broth. Based on this method, we found that during bacterial growth, the AHLs accumulate in the exponential phase, but decreased in the stationary phase. The highest AHLs were determined during late exponential and early stationary phase. Practical Application: In present study, we propose to simplify the calculation of the AHL produced by P.aeruginosa in chicken meat and broth based on the microplate bioassay.

Materials and Methods: Thirty adult male rats (250-300 g) were randomized into (1) ESM conduit, (2) autograft, and (3) sham surgery groups. The eggs submerged in 5% acetic acid. The decalcifying membranes were cut into four pieces, rotated over the teflon mandrel and dried at 37°C. The left sciatic nerve was surgically cut. A 10-mm nerve segment was cut and removed. In the ESM group, the proximal and distal cut ends of the sciatic nerve were telescoped into the nerve guides. In the autograft group, the 10 mm nerve segment was reversed and used as an autologous nerve graft. All animals were evaluated by sciatic functional index (SFI) and electrophysiology testing. Results: The improvement in SFI from the first to the last evalution in ESM and autograft groups were evaluated. On days 49 and 60 post-operation, the mean SFI of ESM group was significantly greater than the autograft group (P< 0.05). On day 90, the mean nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of ESM group was greater than autograft group, although the difference was not statistically significant (P> 0.05). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that ESM effectively enhances nerve regeneration and promotes functional recovery in injured sciatic nerve of rat.","Cited By :24

Currently, fibrin sealant has been successfully used in many surgical fields, but it has several disadvantages, including possible virus transmission, low adhesive strength, and high cost. In this study, gelatin and glutaraldehyde (GA) solutions were chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-linked gelatin gel as sealant and barrier, both of which have long been used in medical applications. It was found that the gelatin gel prepared from 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA solutions exhibited bonding strength almost three times higher than that of fibrin glue. The bonding strength increased with the increasing gelatin and GA concentrations. When a needle hole on PTFE vascular grafts was sealed with the gelatin gel, the water-resistant pressure significantly increased upon rubbing and was twice higher than that of fibrin glue. The cytotoxicity of gelatin gel was found to be much lower than that of albumin glue prepared at the same composition as commercially available BioGlue®. The gelatin gel was found to be also effective as barrier to prevent adhesion in a rat cecum abrasion model. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/ journalsPermissions.nav.","Cited By :18

The sialic acid-liposome interactions at the molecular level depend on their hydro-lipophilic characteristics. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of conformation of the phospholipid (1,2-Diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and sialic acid (2,8-(N-acetylneuraminic acid)) molecules and the type of interactions induced by the sialic acid molecules on membrane-like systems (liposomes) by 2D NMR (TOCSY, HETCOR, ROESY). The nature of the interaction of sialic acid with the model membrane depends on the structure of the phospholipid headgroups and the hydration of membrane. In ROESY spectra was observed the absence of dipole-dipole couplings within the choline head, between headgroups and glycerol, and between glycerol and fatty acid chains. It indicates an increase of the membrane dynamics in the presence of sialic acid. Moreover, the conformation of sialic acid molecule is changed in the presence of liposomes, which depends on stereochemistry of the chemical groups of the carbon atoms C7 and C8, and oxygen O8. The observed differences between the ROESY spectra of free and liposome bound sialic acid may be a consequence of a changed orientation of the pyranose ring from trans to gauche in the presence of liposomes. The sialic acid penetrate into the phospholipid bilayer to a sufficient depth to allow the dipole interaction. The present result that the correlation signal was found only between the methyl protons from the acetyl group of sialic acid and the methylene tail of phospholipid molecule in the ROESY spectrum indicates that the opposite end of the sialic acid molecule stays in the aqueous phase without interacting with membrane molecules.","Cited By :5

Sampling can be considered representative since it has included the main brands that are marketed in the whole country. Dairy products and eggs are important exposure routes for persistent organic pollutants in humans, and the population of Spain presents high rates of consumption of these foods. The dietary intakes of these contaminants were calculated for children and adults. The highest levels of OCPs and PCBs were detected in cheese samples, whereas milk was the food that showed the highest level of PAHs. The mean daily intake of OCPs was very low and represented less than 0.5% of the tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) of these contaminants, except in the case of dieldrin whose intake was 9.03% of TDI. The intake of dioxin toxic equivalents (TEQs) from these foods, calculated from dioxin-like PCBs, was 14.07% of the TDI (2 pg kg-1 b.w. d-1), being cheese the food that contributed more to this intake. The mean estimated dietary intake of the sum of the 16 PAHs was 92.4 ng kg-1 b.w. d-1 for children, and 35.2 ng kg-1 b.w. d-1 for adults. When we considered the carcinogenic potential of these intakes of PAHs, the calculated values are associated with a 1.6/106 increase in the risk for the development of cancer in an adult, and 1.9/106 in children from eating dairy products and eggs.","Cited By :5

Herring gull chicks were exposed for 44 d to cod liver oil containing a typical mixture of contaminants. Following exposure, food intake was reduced for a one-week period in a subgroup of the chicks. Polyclorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, and brominated flame retardants, as well as a wide range of hydroxy, methyl sulfone, and methoxy compounds were measured in liver, brain, and plasma samples. Additionally, phase I biotransformation enzyme activities and phase I and II messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression were investigated in the liver, brain, or both. Both contaminant exposure and reduced food intake had an increasing effect on the concentrations of HOCs and their metabolites. The HOC exposure and reduced food intake also led to increased 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (EROD) activity, whereas mRNA expression of the biotransformation enzymes increased only following the reduced food intake. Tissue distribution of HOCs and their metabolites was not affected by either contaminant exposure or reduced food intake. In conclusion, the results indicate that biotransformation capacity and formation of HOC metabolites increase during reduced food intake.

However, despite the advances made in recent years, several key issues remain unsettled. One of the main problems relates to the difficulty in designing nanodevices for targeted delivery of genes and other drugs to specific anatomic sites. In this study, we describe the development of a novel chitosan nanobubble-based gene delivery system for ultrasound-triggered release. Methods and results: Chitosan was selected for the nanobubble shell because of its low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and excellent biocompatibility, while the core consisted of perfluoropentane. DNA-loaded chitosan nanobubbles were formed with a mean diameter of less than 300 nm and a positive surface charge. Transmission electron microscopic analysis confirmed composition of the core-shell structure. The ability of the chitosan nanobubbles to complex with and protect DNA was confirmed by agarose gel assay. Chitosan nanobubbles were found to be stable following insonation (2.5 MHz) for up to 3 minutes at 37°C. DNA release was evaluated in vitro in both the presence and absence of ultrasound. The release of chitosan nanobubble-bound plasmid DNA occurred after just one minute of insonation. In vitro transfection experiments were performed by exposing adherent COS7 cells to ultrasound in the presence of different concentrations of plasmid DNA-loaded nanobubbles. In the absence of ultrasound, nanobubbles failed to trigger transfection at all concentrations tested. In contrast, 30 seconds of ultrasound promoted a moderate degree of transfection. Cell viability experiments demonstrated that neither ultrasound nor the nanobubbles affected cell viability under these experimental conditions. Conclusion: Based on these results, chitosan nanobubbles have the potential to be promising tools for ultrasound-mediated DNA delivery. © 2012 Cavalli et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.","Cited By :79

In the A columns series, the composition of the functional monomers and crosslinker was adjusted to yield comparable chromatographic retention regardless of the alkyl chain length. In the B columns series, the composition of the functional monomers and crosslinker was kept constant yielding chromatographic retention, which increased as expected in the order of increasing the n-alkyl chain length. Due to their direct influences on the monolith porosity and retention energetic, the nature and composition of the monomers at a given porogen composition have largely affected the solute's mass transfer characteristics and sorption kinetics, as assessed by the van Deemter plots and separation efficiencies. The C16-monolith of the A series yielded the highest separation efficiency toward small solutes, but the A columns series were inadequate for protein separation. The C8-monolith of the B series provided the best separation efficiency for proteins while for tryptic peptide mapping, the C16-monolith of the A series seems to provide the best separation. For large protein molecules, the energetically ""softer"" C8 surface allowed faster sorption kinetics and in turn improved efficiency, while an energetically ""harder"" C16 surface favored better separation of the smaller size peptide solutes. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Objectives: To investigate the relationship between maternal PFOS and PFOA levels and infant allergies and infectious diseases during the first 18 months of life. Cord blood immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels were also evaluated. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant women from 2002 to 2005 in Sapporo, Japan. Maternal PFOS and PFOA levels were measured in relation to cord blood IgE concentrations (n=231) and infant allergies and infectious diseases (n=343). Characteristics of mothers and their infants were obtained from self-administered questionnaires and medical records. Development of infant allergies and infectious diseases was determined from self-administered questionnaires at 18 months of age. Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in maternal serum and concentrations of IgE in umbilical cord serum at birth were measured. Results: Cord blood IgE levels decreased significantly with high maternal PFOA concentration among female infants. However, there were no significant associations among maternal PFOS and PFOA levels and food allergy, eczema, wheezing, or otitis media in the 18 month-old infants (adjusted for confounders).

Recent studies of influenza non-contact transmission between ferrets and guinea pigs have provided insights into the relative transmission efficiencies of pandemic and seasonal strains, but the infecting dose and subsequent contagion has not been quantified for most strains. In order to measure the aerosol infectious dose for 50% (aID 50) of seronegative ferrets, seasonal influenza virus was nebulized into an exposure chamber with controlled airflow limiting inhalation to airborne particles less than 5 μm diameter. Airborne virus was collected by liquid impinger and Teflon filters during nebulization of varying doses of aerosolized virus. Since culturable virus was accurately captured on filters only up to 20 minutes, airborne viral RNA collected during 1-hour exposures was quantified by two assays, a high-throughput RT-PCR/mass spectrometry assay detecting 6 genome segments (Ibis T5000™ Biosensor system) and a standard real time RT-qPCR assay. Using the more sensitive T5000 assay, the aID 50 for A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) was approximately 4 infectious virus particles under the exposure conditions used. Although seroconversion and sustained levels of viral RNA in upper airway secretions suggested established mucosal infection, viral cultures were almost always negative. Thus after inhalation, this seasonal H1N1 virus may replicate less efficiently than H3N2 virus after mucosal deposition and exhibit less contagion after aerosol exposure. © 2011 MacInnes et al.","Cited By :19

The biosensor consists of a Teflon cell holder and two gold electrodes. Experimental measurements were conducted using DF- 1 cells cultured in DMEM media. Two different experiments were conducted namely; the control experiment (holder contains only DMEM media) and the cell experiment (holder contains both DMEM media and cells). The biosensor was placed in an incubator with optimum settings for cell growth. Impedance measurements were sampled at six hour intervals. Based on these measurements the resistance and capacitance change due to the growth of the DF-1 cells were calculated.

PFHxS also occurred in the Xi River which receives sewage from Shenyang, indicating that urban sewage was the source of PFOS and PFHxS in surface waters in this area. Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in the rainy season showed no significant difference from the dry season in Hun River water, but more PFCs occurred in the rainy season, characterized by a substantial increase of PFHpA (perfluoroheptanoic acid). The mean concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in tap water from Shenyang were 0.39 and 0.85 ng · L-1, with maximum levels of 1.16 and 2.55 ng · L-1, respectively. All samples were below the US drinking water reference values for human health. PFOS and PFUnDA (perfluoroundecanoic acid) were the most abundant compounds in the biota samples. The mean concentrations of PFCs in fish were 6.59 ng · g-1 dry weight. For chicken and duck, levels were 1.65 and 0.69 ng · mL-1 in the serum samples and 0.41 and 1.68 ng · g-1 dry weight in the liver samples, showing a relatively low PFC pollutant level compared with those reported in other countries.","Cited By :7

The IBDV vp2 gene was cloned into pFastBacHTA donor plasmid, followed by generation of the recombinant bacmid DNA pBac-VP2. The latter was used to transfect insect cell Sf9 with Lipofectamine to produce recombinant baculovirus vBac-VP2. The Sf9 cells infected with vBac-VP2 were stained positive against IBDV antibody using the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which was also confirmed by the detection of IBDV Vp2 protein in the infected Sf9 cells by IBDV sandwich ELISA. Western blotting revealed that the calculated protein of approximately 53 kDa was in the expressed in the insect cells. Moreover, virus-like particles (VLPs) and ""inclusion body-like""structure in the infected Sf9 cells were observed under electron microscopy. We further developed an indirect ELISA for the detection of the IBDV antibodies, which was specific and sensitive. In addition, the lysates of vBac-VP2 infected cells was used to immunize 2-week-old SPF chickens, followed by challenging with the virulent IBDV, the survival rate was 30% at 14 days post primary immunization, however, the survival rate was 100% at 14 d after the booster vaccination. The ELISA antibody titers was up to 3.2×10 3 and neutralization antibody titer was 2536, significantly higher than those of one-shot vaccination, 8×10 2 and 1106, respectively.

Reduction of the number of Campylobacter-colonized broiler flocks could potentially be realized by decreasing their susceptibility for colonization. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of feed supplementation with a mixture of medium chain fatty acids (C8-C12) on susceptibility of broilers for Campylobacter colonization, feed conversion and body weight gain. Two experiments were carried out with individually housed commercial broilers. The birds were fed with medium chain fatty acids supplemented feed (n=227), or received feed without supplement (n=87). The birds were inoculated with a dose of Campylobacter jejuni varying between log101.19-5.47CFU. During 14 days after inoculation, cecal or fecal samples were collected, in which the presence of C. jejuni was determined by bacterial culture. Beta-binomial dose-response modeling of the colonization status at 14 days post-inoculation was performed to estimate the C. jejuni dose necessary to colonize 50% of inoculated broilers, which was estimated to be 200 times higher in broilers fed with supplemented feed (log104.8CFU) than in control broilers (log102.5CFU). Feed conversion was not affected by feed supplementation, while body weight gain was 49g higher in broilers fed with supplemented feed. These findings indicate that susceptibility of broilers for Campylobacter colonization is decreased by supplementation with medium chain fatty acids, and that feed supplemented with this mixture may be a promising tool for the reduction of Campylobacter colonization in commercial broiler flocks. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :37

Among these contaminants are those subjected to global bans or restrictions in North America and Europe (e.g., legacy OCs, penta- and octa-PBDE technical mixtures, and mercury). In addition, some currently produced chemicals were found in gulls that lack any global use regulation (e.g., deca-PBDE, HBCD, and other non-PBDE BFR additives, siloxanes, and selected PFASs). Svalbard glaucous gulls are also exposed to contaminant metabolites that, at times, are more bioactive than their precursors (e.g., oxychlordane, p,p'-DDE, OH- and MeSO2-PCBs, and OH-PBDEs). Concentrations of legacy OCs (PCBs, DDTs, CHLs, CBzs, dieldrin, PCDD/Fs, and mirex) in tissues, blood, and eggs of Svalbard glaucous gulls have displayed the highest contamination levels among glaucous gull populations that inhabit Greenland (Cleemann et al. 2000), Jan Mayen (Gabrielsen et al. 1997), Alaska (Vander Pol et al. 2009), and the Canadian Arctic (Braune et al. 2005). To date, measurements obtained on more novel organohalogens (e.g., OH- and MeSO2-containing metabolites, BFRs, and PFASs) in Svalbard glaucous gull samples generally confirm the spatial and trophodynamic trends of the legacy OC concentrations, whereas no clear trend emerges from surveys of trace elements and organometals.

In the present study, a high adhesive force and sealing effect were obtained by first rubbing fibrinogen solution into the target tissue, attaching polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt to the treated area, and finally spraying it with FS. This method was compared with three conventional FS application methods and a method using fibrin glue-coated collagen fleece. The adhesive force resulting from the present method was 12 times higher than that for the sequential application method, 4.5 times higher than the spray method, 2.5 times higher than the rubbing and spray method, and 2.2 times higher than the use of fibrin glue-coated collagen fleece. The high adhesive force of FS with PGA felt seemed to be due the high fibrin content of the fibrin gel (FG). Light and electron microscopic observations suggested that the formation of FG in closer contact with the muscle fibers was a factor contributing to this superior adhesive force.

The cause of cardiac injury was stab wounds in 8 patients (50%), iatrogenic reasons in 6 patients (37.5%) and shotgun wounds in 2 patients (12.5%). RESULTS Exposure to the heart was accomplished by a median sternotomy in 12 patients (75%) and a left-sided anterolateral thoracotomy in 4 patients (25%). The right ventricle (RV) was injured in 7 patients (43.75%), left ventricle (LV) in 3 patients (18.75%), left atrium (LA) in 1 patient (6.25%), LV+LA in 1 patient (6.25%), and coronary arteries in 4 patients (25%). Cardiac wounds were treated by simple suture technique over Teflon or pericardial pledgets in all patients. Two patients died in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSION The basis for successful management of penetrating cardiac trauma is effective resuscitative measures followed by early detection and definition and emergency surgical treatment of the injury.","Cited By :3

METHODS: A proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction method was used to extract dsRNA genome from IBDV. VP2 gene was amplified by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) with the genome RNA as template. The pFastBac-pCMV-VP2 baculovirus transfer vector was constructed by inserting VP2 gene under the immediate-early promoter of cytomegalovirus. The VP2 recombinant bacmid was obtained by Bac-to-Bac system and transfected sf9 insect cell to acquire VP2 recombinant baculovirus. After amplification of recombinant baculovirus on cell passages, the recombinant virus was seeded on chicken primary myoblast cells with 50 multiplicity of infection (MOI), and the cells were harvested at 72 hours after infection. RESULTS: Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Poly-Acrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot results showed that the VP2 gene was successfully expressed in chicken primary myoblast cells. The product was a 48kDa protein and could be recognized by anti-IBDV serum. CONCLUSION: The recombinant baculovirus could efficiently delivery IBDV VP2 gene into chicken primary cells and that CMV, a mammalian-cell-active promoter, was functional in chicken primary cells and could direct the expression of VP2 antigen protein. The research can be a potential basis for the development of baculovirus vector vaccines for IBDV and other avian infectious disease.","Export Date: 24 May 2022

Due to the elevated ammonia and particulate matter (PM) levels in poultry houses, it is possible that SlA are partly responsible for the high fine PM concentrations. Hence, the objectives of this study were to develop a methodology to quantify the concentrations of secondary particulates and total PM in a small-scale layer facility to investigate the possibility of SIA formation arising from interactions between ammonia and the acid gases. The instrumentation used to estimate the SIA species was an annular denuder system (ADS) with a two-stage filter pack. The ADS was used to strip the ammonia and acid gases from the sample air stream before collecting particulates on a Teflon filter with a backup nylon filter. Filter extractions were analyzed with an ion chromatography system to determine concentrations of the ion species. In addition, two particle counters were used to measure the total PM2.5 and PM10 in the layer facility. Three air samples were taken from inside the layer house. SIA concentrations were found to be approximately 0.033, 0.011, 0.025 mg/m3 in the air samples, which were all significantly higher than background concentrations near the air intakes. Also, secondary PM contributed to roughly 50, 47, and 99% of the total PM2.5 in the house. These preliminary findings suggest that SlA are formed in poultry houses and, as such, it may be feasible to reduce PM levels by directly targeting ammonia and/or the acid gases.","Cited By :5

The Stockholm convention bans 12 prominent persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and the pertinent global monitoring programme recommends birds' eggs as bio-indicators for the terrestrial food web. As top predators, Peregrine falcons are uniquely suited indicators because of their accumulating power for persistent and lipophilic compounds. On the other hand, the Peregrine falcon as a sentinel species was closer to extinction than other birds of prey. Only unremitting efforts of private ornithologists throughout the past four decades in conjunction with the timely banning of organochlorine pesticides like DDT succeeded in saving the Peregrine population of Baden-Wuerttemberg from extinction, in contrast to the Peregrine falcons of other German states or other European countries. Methods. See vd Trenck et al. (2006). Results and Conclusions. New results confirm the findings of the past long-term bio-monitoring. The main pollutants are PCBs (ca. 20 μg/g) and pp'-DDE (ca. 11 μg/g), the latter contributing >96% of all organochlorine pesticide residues (all concentrations on a dry matter basis). Both substances have followed a slightly increasing trend since 2004. The sum of the polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) has fluctuated strongly in the past four years, and in 2006 amounted to 0.6 μg/g (mean without outliers), just as the mercury contamination of the eggs. PCB-156 as the main dioxin-like PCB followed with an average concentration of 0.35 μg/g. Only 10 out of 23 eggs analysed contained hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in measurable concentrations; the mean concentration of these eggs was 0.024 μg/g. Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA) was detected in all egg samples with a mean of 0.004 μg/g. Due to the many and diverse effects exerted by PCBs, the assessment of this group of compounds, with the aid of European and German regulations for food, proves to be a complex matter, which is currently in a state of flux. There is no doubt, however, that the mean pollution of the Peregrine eggs with toxic dioxin equivalents (WHO TEQ) has reached the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) known for chickens and osprey chicks, and the most polluted eggs exceed this threshold considerably. The toxic profile of PBDEs is similar to that of PCBs. They are known to promote tumour growth, to interfere with the thyroid hormone system resulting in toxicity for the neuronal development, to suppress the immune system, and to trigger stress reactions. Tests with highly purified BDE-47 have ruled out dioxin-like effects via Ah-receptor binding for this congener and such effects are therefore very unlikely for the whole class of compounds. At the present time, quantitative criteria for the assessment of the risk posed by PBDEs are not sufficiently reliable, and less so for HBCD and TBBA. Recommendations and Perspectives. It is necessary to continue the bio-monitoring of POPs and similar pollutants in the terrestrial food web and to establish NOAELs as quantitative criteria for their assessment. Possible sources of dioxin-like PCBs and PCDD/Fs are to be pinpointed, and abatement measures are to be considered where background concentrations are significantly exceeded. © 2007 ecomed verlag (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Cited By :5

The screening-value water concentrations less than or equal to 1.2μg PFOS/L would not pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms.

The tissue-based TRV for fish was determined to be 87μg PFOS/kgww. For terrestrial plants, a screening benchmark was determined to be 1.3 mg PFOS/kg soil ww or 1.5 mg PFOS/kg soil dw, whereas for soil invertebrates such as earthworms the benchmark value was 39mg PFOS/kgdw soil or 33mg PFOS/kgww soil.

This recent body of work has led to a better understanding of the current levels and spatial and temporal trends of contaminants in biota, including the marine food species that northern peoples traditionally consume. Compared to other circumpolar countries, concentrations of many organochlorines (OCs) in Canadian Arctic marine biota are generally lower than in the European Arctic and eastern Greenland but are higher than in Alaska, whereas Hg concentrations are substantially higher in Canada than elsewhere. Spatial coverage of OCs in ringed seals, beluga and seabirds remains a strength of the Arctic contaminant data set for Canada. Concentrations of OCs in marine mammals and seabirds remain fairly consistent across the Canadian Arctic although subtle differences from west to east and south to north are found in the proportions of various chemicals. The most significant development since 1997 is improvement in the temporal trend data sets, thanks to the use of archived tissue samples from the 1970s and 1980s, long-term studies using archeological material, as well as the continuation of sampling. These data cover a range of species and chemicals and also include retrospective studies on new chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers. There is solid evidence in a few species (beluga, polar bear, blue mussels) that Hg at some locations has significantly increased from pre-industrial times to the present; however, the temporal trends of Hg over the past 20-30 years are inconsistent. Some animal populations exhibited significant increases in Hg whereas others did not. Therefore, it is currently not possible to determine if anthropogenic Hg is generally increasing in Canadian Arctic biota. It is also not yet possible to evaluate whether the recent Hg increases observed in some biota may be due solely to increased anthropogenic inputs or are in part the product of environmental change, e.g., climate warming. Concentrations of most ""legacy"" OCs (PCBs, DDT, etc.) significantly declined in Canadian Arctic biota from the 1970s to the late 1990s, and today are generally less than half the levels of the 1970s, particularly in seabirds and ringed seals. Chlorobenzenes and endosulfan were among the few OCs to show increases during this period while ∑HCH remained relatively constant in most species. A suite of new-use chemicals previously unreported in Arctic biota (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), perfluoro-octane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs)) has recently been found, but there is insufficient information to assess species differences, spatial patterns or food web dynamics for these compounds. Concentrations of these new chemicals are generally lower than legacy OCs, but there is concern because some are rapidly increasing in concentration (e.g., PBDEs), while others such as PFOS have unique toxicological properties, and some were not expected to be found in the Arctic because of their supposedly low potential for long-range transport. Continuing temporal monitoring of POPs and Hg in a variety of marine biota must be a priority. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Cited By :310

L7R 4A6, Canada""]","Anthropogenic contaminants have been a concern in the Canadian arctic for over 30 years due to relatively high concentrations of bioaccumulating and biomagnifying organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and toxic metals found in some arctic biota and humans. However, few studies have addressed the potential effects of these contaminants in Canadian arctic wildlife. Prior to 1997, biological effects data were minimal and insufficient at any level of biological organization. The present review summarizes recent studies on biological effects related to contaminant exposure, and compares new tissue concentration data to threshold effects levels. Weak relationships between cadmium, mercury and selenium burdens and health biomarkers in common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima borealis) in Nunavut were found but it was concluded that metals were not influencing the health of these birds. Black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) examined near PCB-contaminated Saglek Bay, Labrador, had enlarged livers, elevated EROD and liver lipid levels and reduced retinol (vitamin A) and retinyl palmitate levels, which correlated to PCB levels in the birds. Circulating levels of thyroid hormones in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) were correlated to PCB and HO-PCB plasma concentrations, but the impact at the population level is unknown. High PCB and organochlorine pesticide concentrations were found to be strongly associated with impaired humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in polar bears, implying an increased infection risk that could impact the population. In beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), cytochromes P450 (phase I) and conjugating (phase II) enzymes have been extensively profiled (immunochemically and catalytically) in liver, demonstrating the importance of contaminants in relation to enzyme induction, metabolism and potential contaminant bioactivation and fate. Concentrations of OCs and metals in arctic terrestrial wildlife, fish and seabirds are generally below effects thresholds, with the possible exception of PCBs in burbot (Lota lota) in some Yukon lakes, Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), glaucous and great black-backed gulls (Larus hyperboreus and L. marinus), and TEQs of dioxin-like chemicals in seabird eggs. PCB and DDT concentrations in several arctic marine mammal species exceed effects thresholds, although evidence of stress in these populations is lacking. There is little evidence that contaminants are having widespread effects on the health of Canadian arctic organisms, with the possible exception of polar bears. However, further research and better understanding of organohalogen exposure in arctic biota is needed considering factors such as tissue levels that exceed effects thresholds, exposure to ""new"" organohalogen contaminants of concern, contaminated regions, and climate change.","Cited By :147

The major organohalogens detected were PCBs (median 2,600 ng/g lipid, range 790-23 000 ng/g lipid). PCB 153,138/163, 170, 180 and 187 were the predominant congeners and constituted 71% of total sum PCBs. PBDEs were measurable in all samples, but their concentrations were much lower than for PCBs, with a range from 29-572 ng/g lipid (median 108 ng/g lipid). The most prevalent PBDE congeners in little owl egg samples were BDE 47, 99 and 153. This profile differs from the profile in marine bird species, for which BDE 47 was the dominant congener, indicating that terrestrial birds may be more exposed to higher brominated BDE congeners than marine birds. The fully brominated BDE 209 could be detected in one egg sample (17 ng/g lipid), suggesting that higher brominated BDEs may accumulate in terrestrial food chains. Brominated biphenyl (BB) 153 was determined in all egg samples, with levels ranging from 0.6 to 5.6 ng/g lipid (median 1.3 ng/g lipid). Additionally, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) could be identified and quantified in only two eggs at levels of 20 and 50 ng/g lipid. OCPs were present at low concentrations, suggesting a rather low contamination of the sampled environment with OCPs (median concentrations of sum DDTs: 826 ng/g lipid, sum chlordanes: 1,016 ng/g lipid, sum HCHs: 273 ng/g lipid). Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and octachlorostyrene (OCS) were also found at low median levels of 134 and 3.4 ng/g lipid, respectively.

It has been demonstrated that rigor development at elevated temperatures, as with slow chilling, can cause meat to develop pale color and poor water-holding capacity. The objective of this study was to compare the functionality of broiler breast meat from control and electrically stimulated carcasses with and without normal rapid chilling. Broilers were either electrically stimulated (450 mA, 450 V, 2 s on, 2 s off for 7 pulses) immediately after bleeding or used as nonstimulated controls. The ES birds were either chilled immediately (ES2) or had chilling delayed for 2 h at room temperature (ESD2). All ES breast fillets were harvested at 2 h postmortem. The control carcasses were chilled immediately and had fillets harvested at 2 h postmortem (C2) or at 8 h postmortem (C8). Electrical stimulation accelerated pH decline and prevented toughening when breast meat was deboned at 2 h postmortem, regardless of chilling rate. The water released from the gels during cooking was higher for the ESD2 than the ES2 group, which was not different from the C2 group, suggesting that ES followed by slow chilling reduced water-holding capacity compared with the ES2 and C2 groups. There were no differences in expressible moisture, gel strength, or lightness among the ES2, ESD2, and C2 treatments. These results indicated that high voltage ES followed by normal chilling did not impair protein functionality or cause pale, soft, exudative meat. However, there was some evidence that slow chilling after ES may negatively affect some water-holding properties of the meat. ©2005 Poultry Science Association, Inc.","Cited By :8

However, the only successful transgenic bioreactors have been based on mammals. We have developed two key techniques for obtaining transgenic birds. For bird embryo culture, we identified that the low rate of hatchability of cultured embryos is caused by limited oxygen and calcium availability. In quail embryo culture using a chicken eggshell as a culture vessel, hatchability increased to 80% by the supplement of calcium lactate in addition to oxygen aeration. A fully artificial vessel for quail embryo culture using a gas-permeable Teflon membrane was also designed. Although the hatchability was lower than that of cultures using a surrogate eggshell, we succeeded in hatching of bird embryos using a fully artificial vessel. For transgene introduction, a replication-defective pantropic retroviral vector based on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) was injected to laid embryos at the blastodermal stage, and the embryos were hatched in vitro to generate G0 birds.

A destruction procedure using HNO3 and H 2O2 was also optimised and the average recovery of the digestion of a solution of selenomethioneine was 92 ± 4% (n=14). Combination of this digestion with the detection system gave reliable results. Accuracy was tested by comparison with two independent methods. A very low detection limit (DL) of 0.2 ng/g of measuring solution was achieved. The whole procedure from weighing to measuring was performed in the same Teflon tube. The addition of HNO3 to the fractions before long term storage at -20°C was necessary to prevent adsorption on the test tubes.

Oscillations and noise decrease, comfort in the vehicle increases, and loads on the components that make up the drive train decrease. Also, another kind of mechanical torsion damper uses a sliding bearing to smooth the relative motion between the strongly oscillating motor side primary part and lesser oscillating gear train side secondary part. The beating cross section is illustrated. It consists of three layers, namely, a PTFE compound, expanded metal, and steel backbone. Bronze is used as the expanded metal. The compounded PTFE contains carbon/graphite and PTFE. The test method and results are described. Another example of the use of a composite material was tested for bolt/valve cover systems.

To test the hypothesis that Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral imaging, coupled with multivariate data processing techniques, can image the spatial distribution of matrix constituents in native and engineered cartilage samples. Methods. Tissue sections from native and trypsin-digested bovine nasal cartilage (BNC) and from engineered cartilage, generated by chick sternal chondrocytes grown in a hollow fiber bioreactor, were placed either on calcium fluoride windows for FTIR analysis or gelatinized microscope slides for histologic analysis. Based on the assumption that cartilage is predominantly chondroitin sulfate (CS) and type II collagen, chemical images were extracted from FTIR spectral imaging data sets using 2 multivariate methods: the Euclidean distance algorithm and a least-squares approach. Results. Least-squares analysis of the FTIR data of native BNC yielded a collagen content of 54 ± 13% and a CS content of 37 ± 16% (mean ± SD). Euclidean distance analysis of measurements made on trypsin-digested BNC demonstrated only trace amounts of CS. For engineered cartilage, the CS content was significantly lower (15 ± 5%), while the collagen content (73 ± 6%) was significantly higher than biochemically determined values (CS 34%, collagen 5%, protein 61%). These differences are due to the fact that the dimethylmethylene blue assay overestimated the CS content of the tissue because it is not specific for CS, while the FTIR spectral imaging technique overestimated the collagen content because it lacks specificity for different proteins. Conclusion. FTIR spectral imaging combines histology-like spatial localization with the quantitative capability of bulk chemical analysis. For molecules with a unique spectral signature, such as CS, the FTIR technique coupled with multivariate analysis can define a unique spatial distribution. However, for some applications, the lack of specificity of this technique for different types of proteins may be a limitation.","Cited By :140

Blokchin Cancer Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Kashirskoye shosse 24, 115478 Moscow, Russian Federation","As shown earlier, the cells transformed in vitro by various oncogenes, during subsequent in vivo growth were gradually replaced by descendant tumor cells, which co-expressed highly increased H2O2-catabolizing antioxidant activity (H2O2/CA), and the ability to release PGE2 (PGES) in contact with natural killer cells; v-src was the only oncogene, which in vitro induced cells transformation characterised with the expression of [H2O2/CA + PGES] phenotype. Expression of [H2O2/CA + PGES] phenotype was providing tumor cells with significantly increased resistance to cytotoxic activities of macrophages and NK cells. However, the possible involvement of [H2O2/CA + PGES] phenotype in primary carcinogenesis remained obscure. Here, using three models of the primary virus-induced Syrian hamster tumors we demonstrated that Rous Sarcoma Virus-induced tumors arising after short latent period expressed [H2O2/CA + PGES] phenotype at appearance. During the latent periods of SV40- and SA7(C8)-induced tumors the cells expressing [H2O2/CA + PGES] phenotype gradually replaced the original [H2O2/CA + PGES]-phenotype-negative cell populations. The effectiveness of such selection correlated with the duration of in vivo tumor development. Thus it was shown, that selection of tumor cells expressing [H2O2/CA + PGES] phenotype is beginning and may be completed during the latent period of primary carcinogenesis. Taken together, data of this and preceding our studies on [H2O2/CA + PGES] phenotype demonstrate that in vivo the host innate immunity antitumor reactions are apparently responsible for the selection of rare tumor cell variants capable to defend themselves against CTA of Mph and NK. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Cited By :3

The study was conducted on 30 adult Wistar rats. On each animal, two symmetrical, 6 mm wide, full-thickness, skull defects were created in the parietal regions. The right defect was chosen as the experimental site and the left one was left empty as a control. Each experimental site was covered by an inner and outer membrane. The 30 rats were divided into three groups: In group 1 (n = 10), a non-resorbable polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) membrane was used. In group 2 (n = 10), a resorbable polyglactin 910 membrane was used. In group 3 (n = 10), a collagen membrane processed from avian eggshell was used. In each group, the animals were euthanized at 60 days. The harvested specimens were processed for contact radiography and standard histological examination. The results were assessed by a Fisher's exact test. In group 1, partial bone healing was observed in seven out of 10 animals and complete in three out of 10 animals (P<0.001). In group 2, no or minimal bone healing was observed in seven out of 10 animals and partial bone healing was observed in three out of 10 animals. In group 3, no or minimal bone healing was observed in nine out of 10 cases and partial bone healing in only one animal. In conclusion, only the non-resorbable e-PTFE membrane group exhibited a favourable result in this study. This study suggests that the structure of the membrane is at least as important as its composition.","Cited By :114

SNOAM uses near-field optics to break the fundamental diffraction limit imposed on normal microscopy. SNOAM can achieve sub-100 nm optical resolutions, but requires transparent, open substrates. The ability to do physiological measurements on patterns of neurons, combined with ultra high resolution optical and fluorescent analysis, is useful in the study of long-term potentiation. The patterning method consists of chemical guidance with an element of physical confinement and allows for ultra-fine patterning of neural growth on transparent glass substrates. Substrates consist of microfabricated perfluoropolymer barrier structures on glass. Poly-L-lysine was selectively deposited using a silicone-based microfluidic stencil aligned to the perfluoropolymer/glass substrate. Primary culture neurons were extracted from 8-day-old chicks and grown for 3 days to form good networks. This patterning system shows very specific growth with patterning separations down to the level of individual neurites.

K1Y 4E9, Canada""]","Although tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) has long been known to be a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin-induced cytodifferentiation in the ovaries of a variety of mammalian species, its early signal transduction events are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that TNF-α induces a small, delayed follicular stage-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) in hen granulosa cells and promotes carbachol (Cch)-induced mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in cells otherwise unresponsive to the cytokine. The focus of the current study was to examine the role of ceramide in TNF-α-induced Ca2+ regulation. Treatment with exogenous sphingo-myelinase (SMase; 50 mU/ml) failed to influence basal [Ca2+](i) but increased the magnitude of Cch-induced Ca2+ transients. While C8-ceramide (0.03-30 μM), but not C2-ceramide (0.03-30 μM), mimicked this effect of SMase, challenge with sphingosine (3 μM) resulted in a slow and delayed increase in basal [Ca2+](i). In order to determine whether SMase is activated by TNF-α action, changes in sphingomyelin and ceramide concentrations in F1 and F5,6 granulosa cells were determined. SMase activation was not observed after 1-, 5-, 15-, and 60-min incubations with TNF-α (1-50 ng/ml) in either F1 or F5,6 cells. Exogenous SMase and C2- ceramide both inhibited LH-induced progesterone production in F1 and F5,6 cells; however, incubation with C8-ceramide resulted in increases in both basal and LH-induced progesterone. In contrast, incubation with TNF-α had no effect on either basal or LH-induced steroidogenesis. In conclusion, our findings indicate that although ceramide regulates [Ca2+](i) and progesterone secretion, the sphingolipid does not appear to play a role in the action of TNF-α in avian granulosa cells. Furthermore, ceramide-mediated responses are highly dependent on acyl chain length, potentially reflecting differences in the abilities of these ceramides to access, bind to, and/or activate ceramide-dependent signal transduction mechanisms. Nonetheless, since TNF-α did not increase the production of ceramide, the physiological regulator(s) of these responses remain unknown.","Cited By :10

Poults fed the FAT diet consumed more feed from 6 to 8 and 9 to 11 d of age than poults fed the CHO diet, intake of the MCT diet was intermediate. From 3 to 11 d of age, the percentage apparent digestibility of nonlipid DM by poults fed the CHO diet was greater than that observed for either the FAT or MCT diets (P ≤ 0.05). The percentage apparent digestibility of lipid was consistently greater for poults fed the MCT diet (≥ 90%) and could be attributed to the high apparent digestibility of C8:0 (&gt;95%), which accounted for 76% of total MCT dietary fatty acids. Over the course of the experiment, the mean percentage apparent digestibility of lipid in the CHO and FAT diets was 76.4 and 70.8%, respectively, and did not change with increasing age. The lower percentage apparent digestibility of lipid in the CHO and FAT diets was attributed to the low apparent digestibility of C16:0 (70.4, 52.7%) and C18:0 (58.4, 26.8%), respectively. The apparent digestibility of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, C18:2 (n-6) and C18:3 (n-3), was consistently high and ranged from 72 to 85% and 81 to 88%, respectively. The CHO diet resulted in an approximate 6% increase in determined AMEn compared with either the FAT or MCT diets. The results of this study showed that commercial feed-grade fats are poorly digested by very young poults. The digestibility of polyunsaturated fatty acids, however, was shown to be quite high, and the data suggest that vegetable oils containing high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids or alternative fat sources containing high proportions of medium-chain fatty acids could be well utilized by the very young poult.","Cited By :10

Residues resulting from the use of chloramphenicol (CAP) is especially problematic if this compound is not used in accordance with national registration, e.g., for the control of Salmonella microorganisms in poultry. The most commonly used methods for the determination of CAP in biological samples require the use of large amounts of organic solvent. As a result, a less solvent intensive supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method was developed for CAP in whole chicken eggs, and the results were compared with those for a solvent extraction procedure. In the SFE method, the egg sample is extracted with supercritical CO2 (without a modifier) at 10 000 psi (680 bar), 80°C, and an expanded gas flow rate of 3.0 L/min to a total volume of 150 L. The CAP is trapped in-line on a Florisil sorbent bed. The CAP is eluted post-SFE by using the liquid chromatographic mobile phase solvent (water-methanol), and determined on a C8 column with ultraviolet detection at 280 nm. Recovery from eggs fortified at the 10 ppb level (n = 6) was 81.2 ± 4.3%. To obtain eggs containing incurred CAP, hens were given a single daily dose of 75 mg CAP (orally by gelatin capsule) for 2 consecutive days, and the eggs were collected over a 12-day period. The mean value for ""normally incurred"" CAP in the eggs (n = 17) analyzed by SFE ranged from none detected to 174.5 ppb, with an overall mean of 60.5 ppb, compared with a mean of 60.4 ppb for the solvent extraction method. No significant difference in resuits was found between methods. However, the SFE method is more rapid, uses less solvent, and gives recoveries similar to those for the solvent extraction method, making it ideal for regulatory monitoring.","Cited By :15

This inhibitory function of CD59 is markedly selective for MAC assembled from human complement components C8 and C9, and CD59 shows little inhibitory function toward MAC assembled from rabbit and many other non-primate species. We have used this species selectivity of CD59 to identify the residues regulating its complement inhibitory function: cDNA of rabbit CD59 was cloned and used to express human/rabbit CD59 chimeras in murine SV-T2 cells. Plasma membrane expression of each CD59 chimera was quantified by use of a 5'-TAG peptide epitope, and each construct was tested for its ability to inhibit assembly of functional MAC from human versus rabbit C8 and C9. These experiments revealed that the species selectivity of CD59 is entirely determined by sequence contained between residues 42 and 58 of the human CD59 polypeptide, whereas chimeric substitution outside this peptide segment has little effect on the MAC inhibitory function of CD59. Substitution of human CD59 residues 42-58 into rabbit CD59 resulted in a molecule that was functionally indistinguishable from native human CD59, whereas the complementary construct (corresponding residues of rabbit CD59 substituted into human CD59) was functionally indistinguishable from rabbit CD59. Based on the solved solution structure of CD59, these data suggest that selectivity for human C8 and C9 resides in a cluster of closely spaced side chains on the surface of CD59 contributed by His44, Asn48, Asp49, Thr51, Thr52, Arg55, and Glu58 of the polypeptide.","Cited By :29

Semen was diluted (1:1) with Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender (BPSE) or BPSE:FC-75, an emulsified mixture of BPSE and perfluorobutyltetrahydrofuran (technical grade) (FC-75) and stored for 24 h at 5 C with agitation (150 rpm) and aeration with either air, nitrogen (100%), or oxygen (100%). Sperm concentration and percentage of dead sperm were determined prior to and after storage. Sperm concentration (8.35 to 9.21 × 109 per milliliter) was not significantly affected by the type of diluent or aeration gas, and only stored semen diluted with BPSE: FC-75 and aerated with nitrogen had increased percentage of dead sperm. Diluent type did not affect the percentage of fertilized eggs; however, fertility and hatchability for both diluent treatments with nitrogen aeration was significantly lower (P ≤ 0.05) than for the semen treatments with air or oxygen aeration. Hatchability for semen diluted with BPSE:FC-75 and aerated with oxygen (63.7%) was significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) than that for BPSE-diluted semen aerated with oxygen (43.2%). Although use of oxygen carrying fluorocarbon emulsified with BPSE did not further improve fertility when the semen was stored for 24 h while oxygenated and mechanically agitated, a beneficial effect was noted for hatchability. The fact that nitrogen severely depressed fertility confirms that the beneficial effects of agitation are due to oxygenation of the spermatozoa. Therefore, further studies of oxygen carriers in semen are warranted.","Cited By :4

High dietary or plasma levels of carotenoids have been strongly associated with decreased risk for age related macular degeneration. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether β-carotene supplementation could reduce light induced photoreceptor cell death. Experiments were performed in Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix) because they have a cone dominant retina which accumulates carotenoids. Methods. Quails from carotenoid deficient eggs were hatched and raised on carotenoid deficient diets for 5 months. For 7 days prior to light exposure, half of the birds were fed diet supplemented with βcarotene. After 28 hours of intermittent 3200 lux light and an additional dark period of 14 hours one retina was frozen for HPLC analyses (in process), the other eye was fixed. Immunohistochemically stained paraffin sections were examined for pycnotic nuclei and microgliat cells. Results. Light exposed, but not unexposed, retinas had numerous pycnotic photoreceptors. β-carotene supplements did not have a significant protective effect on the retina. In areas of light damaged rods and cones, the microglial cells were transformed into large phagocytic cells among the photoreceptors. Conclusions. These results suggest that supplements of β-carotene, which is not typically found in the quail or human retina, are unlikely to influence the resistance of the photoreceptor to light damage.

Three major immunoreactive peaks were purified and found to correspond to 49, 45, and 34 residue peptides by microsequence analysis. The amino acid sequence of the largest peptide was DWLASLSQDQ KHLISKFLPHIYGELAN QEN YWQEDDALHD HDYPGWMDF-amide. The two smaller peptides corresponded to carboxyl-terminal 45 and 34 residue fragments of the 49 residue peptide. The putative proteolysis of the 49 residue peptide to the two shorter peptides occurs at cleavage sites that are unusual in biosynthetic processing. Mass spectral analysis confirmed the molecular weights that were predicted from the amino acid sequences, thus revealing the absence of any post-translational modifications, such as sulfation. Although the three alligator gastrins resemble mammalian cholecystokinin in having a tyrosine residue in the seventh position from the carboxyl terminus, this tyrosine is apparently nonsulfated as in turtle gastrin. When tested by radioreceptor assay, a synthetic replicate of alligator gastrin-49 exhibited a gastrin-like pattern of biological activity on mammalian CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of known peptides revealed that alligator gastrin is most similar to turtle gastrin (76% identical), followed by frog gastrin (51% identical), chicken gastrin (49% identical), and human gastrin (12% identical). These similarities closely reflect vertebrate phylogeny and support the hypothesis that functionally distinct gastrins evolved from Cck in early tetrapods. However, gastrin evolved via different mechanisms in the mammalian lineage (mechanism unknown) versus the amphibian and reptilian/avian lineages, in which two different single nucleotide base changes can account for the separate evolution of amphibian gastrin and reptilian/avian gastrin.","Cited By :2

For each method, the rank order in potency was TCDD ≤ TCDF > PCB 126 > PCB 81 > PCB 77 > PCB 169 in chicken, pheasant, and turkey hepatocytes. The rank order was similar in duck and herring gull hepatocytes with the following exceptions: TCDF was approximately 2- to 4-fold more potent than TCDD in duck hepatocytes; PCB 169 induced EROD in gulls, but PCB 77 had no measurable effect in this species. PCB 118 was a relatively weak EROD inducer in most species/breeds, but it did not induce EROD in Pekin ducks or gulls. PCB 105 was a weak inducer in White Leghorn chicken and turkey hepatocytes, but it did not induce EROD in other species. The EC50, ECTCDD10% and slope ratio methods for estimating potencies generally gave similar IEFs for compounds that produced a maximal response that was at least 60% of the maximal response produced by TCDD. For compounds that caused a response that was 50% or lower than that produced by TCDD, EC50-based IEFs were greater (10- to 100-fold) than ECTCDD10%-based IEFs or slope-ratio-based IEFs. Among species, the rank order in sensitivity to EROD induction was chicken > pheasant > turkey ≤ duck ≤ herring gull. The relative sensitivity of avian hepatocyte cultures to EROD induction by PCB 77 was similar to the relative sensitivity of these species (reported elsewhere) to lethality after in ovo injection of PCB 77. Chicken hepatocyte cultures were 5-10 times more sensitive to EROD induction by TCDD than were pheasant hepatocyte cultures, which is identical to the difference in sensitivity of these species to the lethal effect of TCDD after in ovo injection. Measuring the sensitivity of hepatocyte cultures to EROD induction might be useful for estimating the sensitivity of avian species (including rare or endangered species, where it is impossible to conduct in vivo studies) to the embryotoxic effects of TCDD, non-ortho substituted PCBs, and other aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists.","Cited By :148

As transmitting medium perfluorocarbon liquid was used. Free- running Er:YAG and Ho:YAG laser pulses were delivered into the liquid via a 400 μm fiber. Bubble formation during the ablation process was recorded with fast flash photography while pressure transients were measured with a needle hydrophone. The effect of the surrounding material (air, water, perfluorooctane) on the tissue response of chicken breast was evaluated in vitro using histology. It was observed that a large bubble (up to 6 mm in diameter) was formed under perfluorooctane driven by the ablation products. This bubble, however, does not generate a pressure wave when collapsing. Although perfluorooctane only shows a weak absorption for infrared radiation, laser-induced thermal lensing in the liquid strongly decreases the radiant exposure and therefore the ablation efficiency.","Cited By :10

O. Box 2178, Milwaukee, WI 53233, United States","CD59 antigen is a membrane glycoprotein that inhibits the activity of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC), thereby protecting human cells from lysis by human complement. The inhibitory function of CD59 derives from its capacity to interact with both the C8 and C9 components of MAC, preventing assembly of membrane-inserted C9 polymer. MAC-inhibitory activity of CD59 is species-selective and is most effective when both C8 and C9 derive from human or other primate plasma. Rabbit C8 and C9, which can substitute for human C8 and C9 in MAC, mediate virtually unrestricted lysis of human cells expressing CD59. In order to identify the segment of human C8 that is recognized by CD59, recombinant peptides containing human or rabbit C8 sequence were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. CD59 was found to specifically bind to a peptide corresponding to residues 334-385 of the human C8 α- subunit, and to require a disulfide bond between Cys345 and Cys369. No specific binding was observed to the corresponding sequence from rabbit C8α (residues 334-386). To obtain functional evidence that this segment of human C8α is selectively recognized by CD59, recombinant C8 proteins were prepared by co-transfecting COS-7 cells with human/rabbit chimeras of the C8α cDNA, and cDNAs encoding the C8β and C8γ chains. Hemolytic activity of MAC formed with chimeric C8 was analyzed using target cells reconstituted with CD59. These experiments confirmed that CD59 recognizes a conformationally sensitive epitope that is within a segment of human C8α internal to residues 320-415. Our data also suggest that optimal interaction of CD59 with this segment of human C8α is influenced by N-terminal flanking sequence in C8α and by human C8β, but is unaffected by C8γ.","Cited By :40

Wisconsin Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53233, United States","The CD59 antigen is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that serves as an inhibitor of the C5b-9 complex of complement. This inhibitory activity appears related to the capacity of CD59 to bind with high affinity to sites that are nascently exposed in the α-chain subunit of human C8, as well as within the C9b domain (amino acid residues 245-538) of human C9, during assembly of the C5b-9 complex on the target membrane (Ninomiya, H., and Sims, P. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13675-13680). The CD59 binding site in C9 was first investigated by N-terminal sequencing of CD59-binding peptides generated by limited digest of the isolated C9b domain. These experiments revealed a 17-kDa fragment (starting at C9 residue Thr-320) that retained affinity for CD59, suggesting the possibility for localizing the CD59 binding site by mapping with small C9-derived peptides. Peptides spanning the entire C9b sequence were expressed in Escherichia coli and then probed with CD59. CD59 bound specifically to all peptides starting N-terminal to C9 residue 359 with C termini extending beyond residue 411. Little to no CD59 binding was observed for various C9-derived peptides that started C-terminal to residue 359 or that were truncated N-terminal to residue 411. Affinity-purified antibody against C9 residues 320-411 inhibited CD59 binding to C9 by >50% and completely inhibited its binding to the isolated C9b domain. Little to no specific binding of CD59 was detected for peptides restricted to the putative hinge domain within C9b (residues 245-271). These results indicate that a CD59 binding site is located between residues 320 and 411 of the C9 polypeptide and suggest that the affinity of this site is principally determined by residues 359-411.","Cited By :25

Two PFC were tested for the 30-min experiment: perfluorohexane (FC-72) and perfluorobutyltetrahydrofurane (FC-80). For the 3-h experiment, these PFC plus bis-1,2-(F-butyl)-ethene (F-44E) were studied. The PFC were emulsified with an equal volume of a standard aqueous salt diluent, Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender (BPSE). The BPSE alone was used as a control in both experiments. Semen was diluted 1:2 with oxygen-saturated extender and stored in closed tubes at 20 to 30 C prior to insemination. For the 30-min study, PFC diluents resulted in fertility rates comparable to (FC-72) or significantly greater than (FC-80) BPSE alone (P < or = .05). There was no significant difference in hatchability due to any semen treatment. When semen was stored for 3 h, PFC diluents resulted in comparable (FC-80) or significantly higher (F-44E and FC-72) fertility and hatchability rates. Significantly lower embryonic deaths at Day 10 of incubation were noted for all PFC diluents. These findings provide evidence that PFC emulsions are not toxic and prolong fertilizing capacity of turkey sperm during short-term storage, and suggest that providing oxygen carriers such as PFC in semen diluents may be beneficial.","Cited By :12

Around stage 18 of chick development, a mass of E/C8+ cells surrounds the postotic pharyngeal arches and forms a crescent‐shaped arch, termed the circumpharyngeal ridge. Using immunohistochemistry and quail‐chick chimeras, it was determined that the E/C8+ cell mass located in the circumpharyngeal ridge derives from the dorsolateral component of the cardiac neural crest. The ventrolateral cell population of the cardiac crest is located more medially and shows long‐persistent HNK‐1 immunoreactivity dorsolateral to the foregut. The crest cells that populate the gut arise from the caudal portion of the circumpharyngeal crest and are always located caudal to the caudalmost pharyngeal ectomesenchyme. Circumpharyngeal crest cells continuously populate the pharyngeal arch ectomesenchyme and enteric nervous system on the lateral side of the foregut wall, as well as the hypoglossal pathway which develops within the ventral portion of the circumpharyngeal ridge. E/C8 and HNK‐1 immunoreactivity are associated with the cells migrating via the dorsolateral (circumpharyngeal) and ventrolateral pathways, respectively, with one exception: there is a population of putative crest cells along the proximal course of the vagal intestinal branch that shows both immunoreactivities around stage 20. Dil labeling of the cells in the circumpharyngeal ridge suggests that the cells are contributed from the circumpharyngeal ridge to this population. Thus, the distribution of the circumpharyngeal crest cells and their derivatives coincides with the peripheral branch distribution of the cranial nerves IX, X, and XII, whose development is selectively affected in the absence of the cardiac neural crest, the source of the circumpharyngeal crest.© Willey‐Liss, Inc.

Electrophoretic analyses of solubilized PL confirmed the existence of three major glycoproteins having apparent molecular weights of 33,000, 53,500 and &gt;200,000. The role of carbohydrate in sperm receptor activity was evaluated by extensive deglycosylation of the solubilized PL with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS). Sperm receptor activity as measured by an in vitro competition assay was extremely sensitive to TFMS. Pretreatment of spermatozoa with solubilized PL exposed only to TFMS buffers inhibited sperm attachment and digestion of intact PL by 81% (9.67 ± 1.76 sperm/mm2) as compared with the controls (i.e., no pretreatment of spermatozoa with solubilized PL; 51.33 ± 6.24 sperm/mm2), a value similar to that observed with spermatozoa exposed to untreated solubilized PL (0.17 ± 0.17 sperm/mm2). In comparison, PL treated with TFMS inhibited sperm attachment and digestion of intact PL by less than 26% (38.33 ± 5.88 sperm/mm2) as compared with the control. These data indicate that removal of both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides from components of the chicken PL results in elimination of its sperm receptor activity. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","Cited By :17

In most cases metal implants were used. Biodegradability of implant materials offers new perspectives. Restoration of the physiological status in the implant site becomes possible. Allergic reactions and second operations to remove the implants can be avoided and transitional aid in wound healing by the use of biomaterials can be achieved. An in-vitro system was established to investigate the interactions between osteoclasts and biomaterials, since it is the osteoclasts which are potentially able to resorb or degrade implants. The cell's resorption capabilities as well as its morphological behaviour were documented. Two biodegradable and four nonbiodegradable materials were tested. The non-degradable materials provoked specific cell behaviour patterns but were not resorbed. Fibrin tissue adhesive sealant, however, displayed resorption lacunae mediated by osteoclasts, whereas polydioxanone (PDS) showed no resorption sites but normal cellular morphology when compared to the standard control (cells on hydrophilic coated teflon dishes). Both materials appeared to be well accepted by osteoclasts. This test system was established for the valuation of biodegradable implant materials and can be used to characterize new materials concerning their resorbability and biocompatibility without superposition by other cell systems. © 1992.","Cited By :2

Fecundity initially exceeded mortality and the population growth of c8% per annum could be accounted for by local recruitment. Immigration and emigration of females is an infrequent event. Most breeding males in the population are immigrants from other colonies and thus the demography of the LPB colony may be affected by conditions at other colonies. During the course of the study the colony has increased in size and three fitness components have changed systematically. Clutch size has declined by 0.7 eggs, gosling weight at fledging (and subsequent adult weight) has decreased by 11% and first-year survival has decreased significantly. This has resulted in a decline in the growth rate of the population and is consistent with the operation of density-dependent processes. All these declines could be explained by a decline in the quality and availability of food, and the decline in gosling weight and first-year survival strongly suggests degradation of the arctic salt-marshes where geese rear their broods. Snow geese nest in large colonies and colony demography is probably driven by local food availability. There may be a natural growth and decline of colonies and as long as new arctic salt-marshes are available and protected, the overall population can remain stable. -from Authors","Cited By :37

After final purification, the protein migrated as an 18- to 20-kDa band by SDS-PAGE. Elution from gel slices and functional assay after SDS-PAGE (nonreduced) confirmed that all C5b-9 inhibitory activity of the purified protein resided in the 18- to 20-kDa band. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C digestion of the purified protein abolished 50% of its C5b-9 inhibitory activity, and removed approximately 15% of the protein from human E. Western blots of normal and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria E revealed an absence of the 18- to 20-kDa protein in the paroxysmal noctural hemoglobinuria E cells. The identity of this E protein with leukocyte Ag CD59 (P18, HRF20) was confirmed immunochemically and by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. A blocking antibody raised against the purified protein reacted with a single 18- to 20-kDa band on Western blots of human erythrocyte membranes. Prior incubation of human E with the F(ab) of this antibody increased subsequent lysis by the purified human C5b-9 proteins. Potentiation of C5b-9-mediated lysis was observed when erythrocytes were preincubated with this blocking antibody before C5b-9 assembly was initiated, or, when this antibody was added after 30 min, 0°C incubation of C5b-8-treated E with C9. Chicken E incubated with purified CD59 were used to further characterize the mechanism of its C-inhibitory activity. Preincorporation of CD59 into these cells inhibited lysis by C5b-9, regardless of whether CD59 was added before or after assembly of the C5b-8 complex. When incorporated into the membrane, CD59 inhibited binding of 125I-C9 to membrane C5b-8 and reduced the extent of formation of SDS-resistant C9 polymer. The inhibitory effect of CD59 on 125I-C9 incorporation was most pronounced at near-saturating input of C9 (to C5b-8). By contrast, CD59 did not inhibit either C5b67 deposition onto the cell surface, or, binding of 125I-C8 to preassembled membrane C5b67. Taken together, these data suggest that CD59 exerts its C-inhibitory activity by limiting incorporation of multiple C9 into the membrane C5b-9 complex.","Cited By :312

Crest-derived cells were identified immunocytochemically with the monoclonal antibody, NC-1, and by their ability to give rise to neurons or glia in the bowel. Neurons were recognized by demonstrating acetylcholinesterase activity, neurofilament immunoreactivity, or the immunoreactivity of a neurofilament-associated protein, NAPA-73, with a monoclonal antibody, E/C8. The visualization of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was employed to detect enteric glia. Separate rostral and caudal populations of NC-1-immunoreactive cells were detected in stage 21 embryos (Day E3.5) that extended in continuous streams from the sacral crest to the hindgut. The rostral group, coexpressed neural markers, while the caudal population did not. The rostral, dually labeled cells appeared to become embedded in the mesenchyme of the dorsal bowel by Day E4 and then to enter the mesentery by Day E5 to give rise to the ganglion of Remak. The caudal NC-1-immunoreactive group, which did not express neural markers, appeared to ascend within the colorectum and, in contrast to the rostral cells, fully encircled the gut. NC-1-immunoreactive neurons and glia developed in organotypic tissue cultures and chorioallantoic membrane grafts of both dorsal and ventral halves of the postumbilical bowel explanted at Days E4 and 5, ages known to precede the colonization of the hindgut by cells from the vagal crest. These observations are consistent with the view that NC-1-immunoreactive cells, which do not express neural markers, migrate from the sacral crest to the hindgut. A subset of these cells appears to be capable of giving rise to neurons in vitro, explaining the development of neurons in the explants of the ventral halves of the gut; however, the fate of the sacral crest-derived cells in situ remains to be established. © 1990.","Cited By :102

Prior to axonal outgrowth, fibronectin was distributed in a meshwork throughout the mesenchyme. However, soon after the initiation of axonal outgrowth, fibronectin began to disappear along neuronal pathways. Thus, during the period of active axonal growth, all neural tissues were marked by the striking absence of fibronectin. Interestingly, fibronectin reappeared along peripheral pathways soon after projection patterns were established. The presence of fibronectin in the substrate on which axons grow suggests that fibronectin may provide a permissive substrate for axon extension.

The monoclonal antibody E/C8 was used to localize derivatives of the neural crest in chick embryos. Neural crest was ablated by microcautery of neural folds. Evaluation of thymic development was carried out on serial sections of embryos sacrificed on the sixth day of incubation. The size of the epithelial thymic primordium was smaller in experimental animals than in shams. E/C8-immunoreactivity was concentrated around the periphery of the primordium. It was determined, by quantifying reaction product using the Core-SCAN computer color analysis program, that the amount of immunoreactivity was decreased after ablation of neural crest. Statistical analysis showed that the quantity of reaction product was positively and significantly correlated with the size of the thymic primordium.

This paper reports a preliminary study of the ecology of this species in the Ankarana Special Reserve conducted at the end of the dry season in 1986, with additional information collected a year later. Crowned Lemurs occur in very high densities in the semi-deciduous canopy forest and this probably represents a dry season refuge for the species. They also use more open habitats, including sparsely vegetated limestone and degraded forest. Sanford's Lemur, Lemur fulvus sanfordi, also inhabits the Ankarana forests but is most abundant in degraded habitats. Crowned and Sanford's Lemurs had similar patterns of activity, which included nocturnal travelling and feeding bouts. Crowned Lemurs proved to be unusual among Lemur species in displaying low spatial troop cohesion and a lack of obvious troop hierarchy. Stronglyoides-like enteric helminths infested about one third of Crowned Lemurs but were apparently not causing disease. Crowned Lemurs fall prey to the Fosa, Cryptoprocta ferox, and the young possibly also to the largest raptors. A total of seven living lemur species (including the very rare Propithecus diadema perrieri and Daubentonia madagascariensis) were confirmed at Ankarana by the authors, and three further species have been reported by other observers. In addition to these ten extant lemurs, four subfossil species have been discovered: three of them (Hapalemur simus, Palaeopropithecus and Mesopropithecus) by the authors. The possibility that all 14 lemurs were once sympatric is discussed. For the present, the lemurs of Ankarana are protected from hunting by local taboo. Nevertheless they are under severe threat from habitat destruction, despite Ankarana's Special Reserve status. Given the very restricted distributions of Crowned and Sanford's Lemurs, both must be considered as threatened with extinction.","Cited By :53

Pesticides are classified commercially according to their intended uses, but there is considerable overlap. Ninety percent of all agricultural uses fall into three categories: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Their economic and environmental importance hae increased enormously between 1950 and 1980 as a consequence of a 10-fold expansion in their agriculture application. It is estimated that the U.S. pesticide industry itself uses some 1400 active ingredients in formulations produced by 4600 companies at 7200 plants. These account for the approximately 35.000 brand-name formulations registered with the EPA, encompassing some 60,000 pesticide products on the market. Of a world production now exceeding 4 billion lbs, about 1/2 is used in agriculture, with a mere hundred or so pesticides dominating the agricultural use category (Schardein. ref. 185). By 1971 U.S. agriculture alone consumed 0.5 billion lbs of pesticides, of which 228 million lbs (M)* were herbicides, 170M insecticides. 42M fungicides and 15M rodenticides. Seventy percent of these pesticides were used on three crops: cotton, corn and soybeans. About 180M of the fumigants produced in the U.S. are used annually in rodent and insect control for food storage (grain), soil treatment, and in pest control on food imports and exports (Moses, ref. 164). Classes of chemicals used as pesticides are summarized in Table 24. Inorganics and organometals are included in the table to reflect the full range of chemicals used. In the public health area, the phenomenal but short-lived successes of DDT in controlling disease vectors was noted. In 1955 the WHO had embarked on a program to eradicate malaria. However by the '70s it was evident that the resistance of anopholes to organochlorine pesticides had clearly foiled this plan. 1962 was a peak year for insecticide application in malaria control (130M DDT, 8M Dieldrin, and 1M Lindane). Currently the world ecosystem remains heavily contaminated with synthetic organohalogens highly resistant to biodegradation, and toxic to species all along the food chain. The legacy of our ecologic indiscretions is particularly well documented for endangered avian and estuarine species. The destruction of beneficial insects and plants by pesticides is also a serious concern to farmers, and an incentive to the development of an integrated pest management (XPM) approach - as are economic considerations. For, as insect pests evolved to meet the challenge of the new petrochemically derived pesticides, increasing quantities of costly chemicals were used to overcome insect resistance. Eventually the law of diminishing returns set in, and many a once prosperous American farm enterprise was foreclosed, no longer able to obtain needed farm credit advanced or bank loan extensions*. Organochlorine pesticides are nerve poisons in both insects and mammals. Action mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood. They have been shown to have estrogen-like effects (ref. 84a), to inhibit testicular growth and secondary sex characteristics in cockerels and mice (DDT), to induce persistent estrus in rats, and to affect fertility, gestation, lactation and survival times. Evidence is similar for humans but limited, and includes male sterility, spontaneous abortions in human females, premature human fetuses, severe neurologic and CNS effects, blood dyscrasias, hepatotoxicity, accumulation of organohalogen pesticides in human lipid tissue - and, perhaps even more important, their presence in human breast milk, whence they can continue to exert influences on growth, development and hormonal, CNS and enzyme systems. Aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane, chlordecone (Kepone), heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and Mirex are all excreted via breast milk in the human female. This is also true for the related PCBs and PBBs that resist biodecomposition and maintain persistent residence in mammalian tissues. For them, excretion via breast milk may constitute the main - if not sole - elimination route. Most of the cyclic organohalogen pesticides studied are known or suspect animal carcinogens. The alkyl halide fumigants (methyl bromide, EDB, DBCP) are alkylating agents and mutagens, with adverse reproductive effects as well. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is known to cross the rat placenta and accumulate in the fetus. Deaths of breast fed infants and an epidemic of skin sores and porphyria cutanea tarda in Turkey resulted from the accidental consumption of HCB-contaminated seed grain. The inhabitants of a small Louisiana community also experienced an epidemic of illness, traced to accidental HCB ingestion. Hexchlorophene (HCP) is readily absorbed via the skin and is highly neurotoxic, especially to newborns. Clusters of similar malformations were observed in the offspring of workers exposed to HCP detergent washes. Infants exposed to a 6% HCP powder showed brain stem vacuolizations similar to that induced experimental animals. A Lindane formulation (mixture of BHC isomers) is used as a termiticide. The 1% shempoo,lotion or cream (Kwell) is also used as an ovacide. The α-isomer is a CNS stimulant of high acute toxicity, and caused serious illness including convulsions in a patient when administered as a vermifuge. Applications of lindane preparations have resulted in seizures in young children. Because of their skin-penetrating power, the topical use of lindane preparations is contraindicated in pregnant women. A 1980 study of premature labor and abortions in India found significantly higher pesticide concentrations in the blood and placental tissues of affected women compared with their full-term counterparts (ref. 103). The widely used chlorophenoxy herbicides are chemical teratogens - as are their byproduct chlorodibenzodioxins. The symmetrical tetrachloro compound TCDD is perhaps the most toxic chemical known. It enhances the teratogenic effect of 2,4,5-T by orders of magnitude, even when present at trace (nanogram) levels (synergism). Dioxins are now ubiquitous, thanks to the widespread popularity of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T herbicides for weed control in agriculture and the massive use of Agent Orange in a defoliation and crop destruction program in Vietnam. Between 1966-81 farm use of herbicides had increased 280% to 625M, exceeding total insecticide use. As organochlorine pesticides fell into disfavor the use of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) multiplied and with them a concomitant and increase in morbidity and mortality - particularly among sprayers and farm workers. The OPPs - especially Parathion and Phosdrin - account for more deaths than any other class of pesticides (Moses, ref. 164). OPPe are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with potentially disabling neurotoxic effects. The teratogenicity of OPPS in avian species and fish is well documented. Mammalian data indicate more fetotoxicity than teratogenicity. Still, 10 of the 20 animal teratogena listed in Table 20 are OPPs. Studies of reproductive and teratogenic effects of OPPs on humans are few. Gordon et al. (1981) found stronger correlations of cleft lip and palate malformations for insecticides and/or herbicides than for all other agrichemicals combined, The post mortem examination of women's ovaries following acute intoxication revealed adverse ovarian effects from parathion; and both infertility and menstrual disturbances were observed in female applicators of OPPs. Also, women from fruit growing areas exposed to OPPs experienced earlier menopause, infertility and other functional irregularities - e.g., in the liver and nervous system and in bile production. In addition to the most popular chlorophenoxy herbicides, the group includes a variety of other chemical classes - e.g., amides, bipyridyls, carbamates, dinitrophenols, substituted ureas and triazines. Most of the chemicals tested are animal teratogens, as are many of the fungicides in this miscellaneous group (ref. 185. p. 578 and 586). Carbamates are also used as insecticides and t'ungicides. Their mode of action - acetylcholinesterase inhibition - while similar to that of the OPPs, does not require prior metabolic conversion, and carbamates are more rapidly metabolized. As with OPPs carbaryl was found teratogenic in birds and fish. Rat studies were somewhat more ambiguous (1.12.5). A WHO review of animal experiments reported affected estrous cycles in rats and decreased fertilities of offspring in a 4-generation study. Other reproductive and teratogenic effects reported included omphalocele in rabbits, embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in golden hamsters, resorption and embryotoxicity in miniature swine. Beagles exhibited the greatest variety of abnormalities among mammals studied. Dithiocarbamates affected the male reproductive tracts in rats, decreased sperm motility and viability and caused testicular atrophy. Zineb acted as a sterilant in rats. Disulfiram appeared to act synergistically with tranquilizers, causing spontaneous miscarriages and/or malformations in the fetuses of five women. It also exerts powerful synergistic action with alcohol by inhibition of the enzyme of aldehyde dehydrogenase and acts similarly with EDB to magnify the toxicity and oncogenicity of the latter compound. Ethylenethiourea, a widely present impurity in the dithicarbamate fungicides, is a known animal carcinogen (liver, thyroid) and goitrogen. It also poses a high risk of teratogenesis, particularly of the nervous system. The S(chloroally1)thio- and dithiocarbamates and the α-haloacroleins are potent mutagens.","Cited By :8

However, neural crest cells arise from the dorsal neural tube where they are apparently unsegmented. It is generally agreed that the somites impose segmentation on migrating crest cells, but there is a disagreement about two basic questions: (1) exactly what pathways do neural crest cells use to move through or around somites, and (2) do neural crest cells actively migrate or are they passively dispersed by the movement of somite cells? The answers to both questions are critically important to any further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the precise distribution of the neural crest cells that develop into ganglia. We have done an exhaustive study of the locations of neural crest cells in chick embryos during early stages of their movement, using antibodies to neural crest cells (HNK-1), to neural filament-associated protein in growing nerve processes ( E C8), and to the extracellular matrix molecule laminin. Our results show that (1) Some neural crest cells invade the extracellular space between adjacent somites, but the apparent majority move into the somites themselves along the border between the dermatome/myotome (DM) and the sclerotome. (2) Neural crest cells remain closely associated with the anterior half of the DM of developing somites as they travel, suggesting that the basal lamina of the DM may be used as a migratory substratum. Supporting this idea is our observation that the development of the DM basal lamina coincides in time and location with the onset of crest migration through the somite. (3) The leading front of neural crest cells advance through the somite while the length of the DM pathway remains constant, suggesting active locomotion, at least in this early phase of development. (4) Neural crest cells leave the DM at a later stage of development to associate with the dorsal aorta, where sympathetic ganglia form, and to associate with newly emerging fibers of the ventral root nerve, where they presumably give rise to neuronal supportive cells. Thus we propose that the establishment of the segmental pattern of the peripheral ganglia and nerves depends on the timely development of appropriate substrata to guide and distribute migrating neural crest cells during the early stages of embryogenesis. © 1987.","Cited By :222

Because the decay accelerating factor (DAF) from human erythrocyte membranes also inhibits the activity of C3/C5 convertases in an homologous system, we tested whether or not a DAF activity was present in C8bp. C8bp, however, did not accelerate the decay of the classic C3 convertases.

This finding confirms that imuthiol enhanced effectively T cell-dependent responses but the data on GVH reaction suggest that its effects are under a complex mode of action. Restoration of a normal production of FTS may be one mechanism by which imuthiol acts on the reinduction of the T-cell differentiating pathway in aged mice. © 1986.","Cited By :25

To determine whether the E/C8-antigen corresponds to any of the known NF components, we compared their subcellular locations, immunocross-reactivities, and electrophoretic behaviors. We found that the E/C8-antibody binds to NF bundles in electron microscope preparations of neurons, but does not correspond to any of the known NF proteins by immunological or electrophoretic criteria. Immunoadsorption with the monoclonal antibody resulted in co-purification of a 73,000-D protein with one of the known NF proteins in homogenates from 20-d embryonic chick brains, but with vimentin intermediate filament protein in similarly prepared homogenates from 4-d embryonic chicks. We suggest that the E/C8-antigen is an intermediate filament-associated protein that binds to different filament types at different stages of development. We have named it NAPA-73, an acronym for neurofilament-associated protein, avian-specific, 73,000 D, on the basis of its binding specificity in mature neurons.","Cited By :60

We have recently shown that spheres having densities greater or less than water emptied from the food-filled canine stomach more slowly than spheres of the same diameter with a density of 1. Thus, hydrodynamics seem to govern gastric emptying of spheres. The present studies were undertaken to determine how altering other hydrodynamic factors, viscosity and velocity of fluid outflow, might affect gastric sieving. Ten mongrel dogs were prepared with chronic duodenal fistulas, which allowed collecting and measuring of emptied spheres and food. The dogs were fed a standard meal of 75 g of steak plus 25 g of 99mTc-labeled chicken liver. Immediately afterward, 50 3.2-mm Teflon spheres were instilled into the stomachs along with 200- or 800-ml volumes of saline or saline plus guar (a viscous polysaccharide). Whether 200- or 800-ml volumes were instilled, the guar significantly sped the emptying of the spheres. Fluid outflow was twice as fast after the 800-ml instillates, but the faster outflow with the 800 ml of saline did not speed emptying of spheres. With the guar instillates, the faster outflow slightly sped the emptying of the spheres and significantly increased the diameter of emptied particles of 99mTc-labeled chicken liver. We conclude that meal viscosity significantly affects gastric sieving.","Cited By :58

In the liver of clofibratetreated chick embryo, approximately 50% of total liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activity was present in the peroxisomal fraction. Peroxisomal CPT activity was easily solubilized, in contrast with mitochondrial CPT. The solubilized protein solutions from isolated peroxisomes and mitochondria were separately chromatographed on a column of Blue Sepharose CL-6B after the gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. Peroxisomal CPT was completely bound to a Blue Sepharose CL-6B column and was eluted below 0.25 M KCI, whereas mitochondrial CPT was not retained on the column. The substrate specificity profile of peroxisomal CPT with long-chain acyl-CoAs (C8 to C18) was similar to that of mitochondrial CPT, and the apparent Km value of peroxisomal CPT for palmitoyl-CoA was 5.2μM, being similar to that of mitochondrial CPT.It is concluded that carnitine long-chain acyltransferase, which is different from mitochondrial CPT and is induced by clofibrate treatment, is present in peroxisomes of chick embryo liver. © 1985, by the Japanese Biochemical Society.","Cited By :3

In contrast, these cells do not develop into melanocytes - Another derivative of the neural crest - In various permissive conditions. These results demonstrate that the mesenchymal cells of the posterior branchial arches are a developmentally restricted population of neural crest-derived cells, and some may serve as precursors for neurones of the enteric nervous system. © 1983 Nature Publishing Group.","Cited By :54

This effect was measured by determining a reference binding enthalpy (ΔHref) for 3-carboxymethylriboflavin and subsequently comparing (ΔHref) to the binding enthalpies determined for all other flavin analogs in this study. The reference enthalpy change was measured in detail under a variety of temperatures (14, 25, and 38 °C), pH's (5.5, 6.5, 7.4, 8.5), and buffer types. The reference enthalpy for the binding of N(3)-carboxymethylriboflavin to WRBP was measured as (ΔH) = -20.9 kcal/mol at 25.0 °C and pH 7.4. Evaluation of the binding thermodynamic values for the reference flavin indicates that there is no H+ flux concomitant with binding. A small negative change in heat capacity ((ΔHCp) occurs during the binding process suggesting a contraction of the protein. Finally, the reaction appears to be independent of pH and buffer type indicating little, if any, involvement of charged residues in the binding of flavin to apoWRBP. Thermodynamic values for the binding of an additional eight flavin analogs were then measured at pH 7.4 and 25.0 °C. The thermodynamic binding parameters for these analogs were evaluated by comparison to those determined for the reference flavin. The results indicate that the ribityl C2′ position is a major influence in the interaction between the ribityl side chain and the protein; the C9 position of the isoalloxazine ring is sterically restricted in a manner similar to positions C7 and C8; and the positions C7 and C8 appear to be unequal with regard to enthalpy release, suggesting that the C8 position is the most restricted region in the aromatic ring. These various findings indicate the unique ability of titration calorimetry to evaluate structural variation of ligands to their corresponding binding site interactions. © 1983.","Cited By :9

The epitope (antigenic determinant) to which this antibody binds appears in neuronal cells-of both the peripheral and central nervous systems-and in a limited number of nonneuronal cell types in avian embryos. The epitope is intracellular and is probably part of a protein as judged by its susceptibility to proteases. This epitope appears very early in neuronal development. It may be detected in brain, spinal cord, and ventral root nerve fibers of Hamburger-Hamilton stage 16 chicken embryos (51-56 hr of incubation). At this same age, E C8-immunoreactive cells can be found in the neural crest migratory space between the neural tube and the somite about a day before dorsal root ganglia begin to coalesce. Since some cultured neural crest cells (but not somitic mesenchymal cells) also express this epitope, we propose that the E C8 monoclonal antibody identifies an early differentiating subpopulation of neural crest cells which express this putative neuronal trait soon after the time of cessation of migration in vivo. © 1982.","Cited By :94

Natural and synthetic FTS showed high activity in the rosette test used as a bioassay1,2. Bioassays for thymic hormones4, however, can be spuriously triggered by many substances of non-thymic origin5, a finding probably related to mediation by a cyclic AMP second signal6. Early steps in B-cell differentiation are also mediated by cyclic AMP (refs 6-9) and comparison of induction of T cells and B cells from committed precursor cells in vitro (the dual induction assay) enables a distinction to be made between selective and non-selective inducing agents7,8. This is exemplified by induction studies in the mouse with thymopoietin10,11 and ubiquitin 7,12,13. Bovine thymopoietin selectively induces T-cell differentiation and actually inhibits B-cell differentiation9. By contrast, ubiquitin is non-selective, inducing both T- and B-cell differentiation7. Ubiquitin at high concentrations does not induce differentiation whereas these high concentrations do not impair induction by thymopoietin or other agents8,14. Another feature of induction by ubiquitin is its inhibition by the β-adrenoceptor-blocking drug propranolol, which is without effect on induction by thymopoietin7. We have evaluated synthetic FTS in the dual induction system in the chicken to determine whether it showed inductive selectivity appropriate to a thymic hormone, and have found that it induced non-selective differentiation of both T cells and B cells and closely resembled ubiquitin in its activity. © 1978 Nature Publishing Group.","Cited By :13

The thermodynamically favorable condensation of acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA is catalyzed in chicken liver mitochondria by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG-CoA synthase). This enzyme is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and occupies a potentially favorable position for the regulation of hepatic ketogenesis. The distinctly different properties of this enzyme from those of the cytoplasmic HMG-CoA synthase are consistent with independent regulation of ketogenesis and cholesterogenesis. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase activity can be conveniently determined by a radiochemical assay, which monitors the incorporation of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (volatile 14C activity when taken to dryness at 95° in 6 N HCl) into HMG-CoA (nonvolatile 14C activity when taken to dryness at 95° in 6 N HCl). A spectrophotometric assay can be used to measure the acetyl-CoA-dependent disappearance of acetoacetyl-CoA absorbance at 300 nm. In the course of purification procedure, fresh liver from laying hens is ground in a Universal No. 1 meat chopper and then homogenized in a loose-fitting Potter-Elvehjem tissue homogenizer with a Teflon pestle.

The turkey skin residue fraction contained higher concentrations of carbonyls than did the chicken samples. The oil extract from the skin of both groups was similar in carbonyl concentration. Lower storage temperature dramatically lowered the development of carbonyls. Phospholipid phosphorus determinations indicated the residue contained high levels of polar lipid; whereas, negligible amounts were in the oil. Thin‐layer chromatography of the carbonyl classes from the skin residue indicated mainly C7‐C9 2‐enals and C8, C9 2, 4‐dienals in the unsaturated aldehyde fractions. Changes in fatty acid composition of the residue polar lipids during storage suggested linoleic and arachidonic acids as the probable substrates in autoxidative deterioration.
