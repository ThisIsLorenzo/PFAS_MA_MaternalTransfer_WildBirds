The code of the following chunck merges the various datasheets of my relational database to create a final wide whole datasheet.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
study_details <- read_csv("study_details.csv")
species_info <- read_csv("species_info.csv")
pfas_info <- read_csv("pfas_info.csv")
cohort_info <- read_csv("cohort_info.csv")
sample_info <- read_csv("sample_info.csv")
measurement <- read_csv("measurement.csv")
combined <- inner_join(measurement, sample_info, by = "Sample_ID")
combined <- inner_join(combined, cohort_info, by = "Cohort_ID")
combined <- inner_join(combined, study_details, by = "Study_ID")
combined <- inner_join(combined, pfas_info, by = "pfas_ID")
combined <- inner_join(combined, species_info, by = "Species_ID")
data_combined <- combined %>% 
  select(-c(Timestamp.x, Timestamp.y, Timestamp.x.x, Timestamp.y.y, Timestamp.x.x.x, Timestamp.y.y.y))
View(data_combined)
```
